# Closed shadings

`ShadedBody` asks of a shading only that it be measurable. Two arguments
of the factoring construction need strictly more: the measurability of the Step 2 level set, whose
defining conditions involve a Minkowski sum rather than a preimage, and the projection step of GWZ
Lemma 5.9, where the shade is pushed forward along an orthogonal projection. Both are rescued by
closedness of the shade, through compactness.

This file collects the declarations of the closed variant of the shaded-body structure
:

* `CShadedBody`, the shaded-body structure with `measurableSet_shade` strengthened to
  `isClosed_shade`, together with the coercion `CShadedBody.toShadedBody` that forgets closedness
  and the compactness `CShadedBody.isCompact_shade` of its shade;
* `ShadedBody.closureShade`, the closure operation in the other direction, which imposes
  closedness at no cost in shading mass (`ShadedBody.volume_shade_le_volume_shade_closureShade`);
* `ShadedBody.FactorFamily.closureShade`, the same operation applied to the inner bodies of a
  factor family, with the field equations recording that nothing but the shades changes;
* `ShadedBody.shade_inducedShading_closureShade`, that the induced shading of
  `ShadedBody.inducedShading` does not distinguish a shading from its closure.

/-- A **closed shaded body** is a convex body together with a closed
subset of it, called its shading.

This is the same data as `ShadedBody`, with the field `measurableSet_shade` strengthened to
`isClosed_shade`. The typeclass assumptions are those of `ShadedBody` so that a `CShadedBody`
can eventually be substituted for a `ShadedBody` without changing the ambient context; the
measurable-space structure is used by the coercion `CShadedBody.toShadedBody`, not by the
fields below. -/

of the shade, keeping the carrier and the shade.

why closedness of the new shades is not recorded in the type, but in
