# The `hdilate` clause of the two-sided Frostman transport needs nothing of its container

`ConvexSpaceBody.frostmanConstIn_ge_of_comparable` (`Kakeya/Frostman.lean`) transports the
Frostman constant between two families `W i ≤ V i` inside a container `K` and asks, as its
hypothesis `hdilate`, that

> for every `K' ≤ K` there is an `L ≤ K` with `K' ≤ L`, `|L| ≤ C |K'|` and `V i ≤ L`
> whenever `i ∈ s` and `W i ≤ K'`.

`Kakeya.ml1Boot.exists_fineNormalization_lower` records the reading that this clause "is
false at `K = ConvexSpaceBody.closedUnitBall` — a thin tube tangent to the unit sphere has
its dilate stick out", and that at a larger ambient radius it is a separate geometric condition.  The first
half of that reading is **wrong**, and this file says why in one lemma.

The clause does not ask for `L` to be a dilate of `K'`.  Given any convex enlargement `D` of
`K'` that is large enough to swallow the relevant `V i` and small enough in volume, the
witness

`L = D ⊓ K`   (`ConvexSpaceBody.inter`)

satisfies all four requirements: `L ≤ K` by construction, `K' ≤ L` because `K' ≤ D` and
`K' ≤ K`, `|L| ≤ |D| ≤ C |K'|` by monotonicity of the measure, and `V i ≤ L` because
`V i ≤ D` is the enlargement's clause while `V i ≤ K` is the hypothesis `hVK` that
`ConvexSpaceBody.frostmanConstIn_ge_of_comparable` already carries.  Nothing about `K` is
used — not its radius, not convex position, not volume.  A dilate of `K'` sticking out of `K`
is harmless, because only the part of it inside `K` is ever needed.

So the real content of `hdilate` is entirely local: the **per-body enlargement**
`∀ i ∈ s, W i ≤ K' → V i ≤ D` at a `D ⊇ K'` of comparable volume.  That is a statement about
`W`, `V` and `K'` alone, and it is what a producer has to prove.  It does not follow from
`W i ≤ V i` plus `|V i| ≤ C |W i|`: a needle `V i` of the same volume as `W i` but far
longer contains `W i`, is volume-comparable to it, and leaves every constant-volume
enlargement of `K' = W i`.  What is available in the normalization is stronger than volume
comparability — `V i` is the centred extension of `W i` to core length `1`, hence sits in a
bounded dilate of `W i` — and that is the shape a producer should aim at.

/-- **A container-side witness, out of a container-free enlargement.**

If every `K' ≤ K` admits a convex enlargement `D ⊇ K'` of volume at most `C |K'|` that
contains the `V i` of those `i` with `W i ≤ K'`, then the `hdilate` clause of
`ConvexSpaceBody.frostmanConstIn_ge_of_comparable` holds at `K`.  The witness is `D ⊓ K`, and
the only thing used about `K` is the hypothesis `hVK : ∀ i ∈ s, V i ≤ K`, which that lemma
already assumes. -/

/-- **The `hdilate` enlargement clause, from a per-body homothety presentation.**

Suppose each `V i` is contained in the image of `W i` under a homothety of ratio `λ ≥ 1`
centred at *some point of `W i` itself* -- the centre may differ from `i` to `i`.  Then the
container-free enlargement hypothesis of
`ConvexSpaceBody.exists_dilate_witness_of_enlargement` holds with the dimensional constant
`(4 λ) ^ n * n !`, so `hdilate` follows.

The enlargement is `Convex.exists_homothety_container` applied to `K'` itself, which swallows
every homothety image of every `W i ≤ K'` at once precisely because the container's defining
property quantifies over the homothety centre.

The degenerate case is handled without a hypothesis on `K'`: if some `W i ≤ K'` then
`|K'| ≠ 0` because `|W i| ≠ 0`, and if no `W i ≤ K'` then `D = K'` works, the constant
being at least `1`. -/
