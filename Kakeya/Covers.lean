# Boundedly overlapping covers

This file formalizes blueprint Subsection `subsec:covers`. Many arguments in this development
cover a set by balls that are allowed to overlap, but only boundedly often, and then sum a
quantity over the balls of the cover. The notion is fixed once here, with the overlap constant
made explicit, together with the consequences used downstream:

* `Kakeya.IsBoundedlyOverlappingCover`: the notion
  itself;
* `Kakeya.IsBoundedlyOverlappingCover.sum_volume_le_mul_volume_iUnion` and
  `Kakeya.IsBoundedlyOverlappingCover.sum_volume_le_mul_volume_cthickening`: the volume sum, in the
  two forms the blueprint records;
* `Kakeya.sum_volume_inter_ball_le`: the restricted
  volume sum, which needs the overlap bound only and not the covering property;
* `Kakeya.exists_volume_inter_ball_ge`: the averaging
  pigeonhole over the balls of a cover;
* `Kakeya.exists_subordinatePartition` and
  `Kakeya.sum_volume_inter_partition_eq`: the
  measurable partition subordinate to a cover and the *exact* mass identity it supplies —
  which is what a cover, being lossy by a factor `D`, does not give;
* `Kakeya.exists_separatedNetCover` and its five
  ingredients: the covers produced by a maximal separated set;
* `Kakeya.exists_mem_volume_inter_ball_ge`: a set of bounded
  diameter has a subball of comparable radius carrying a proportional share of its mass.

The overlap constant `D` is always carried explicitly; in every application in this development
it depends only on the ambient dimension.

The radius has to be *doubled*: the balls are only assumed to meet `S`, so their centres need

Integrating the pointwise overlap bound `∑ i, 1_{B i} ≤ D` over a measurable set `F` gives
`∑ i, |F ∩ B i| ≤ D |F|`.

A set `Z` covered by the balls `B i`, `i ∈ s`, and of measure at least `α ∑ i, |B i|`, is an
`α`-fraction of at least one of them.

The blueprint states this for balls of a *common* radius, so that `∑ i, |B i| = |s| · v`; the
argument needs no such hypothesis, since `α ∑ i, |B i| = ∑ i, α |B i|` and the pigeonhole
`ENNReal.exists_le_of_sum_le` compares the two sums termwise. (The generic
`Finset.exists_le_of_sum_le` does not apply: it needs a cancellative ordered monoid, which
`ℝ≥0∞` is not.) -/

section Partition

variable {E : Type*}

/-- **A measurable partition subordinate to a boundedly overlapping cover**.

Given a finite family of measurable sets `(B i)_{i ∈ s}` there are measurable pieces
`P i ⊆ B i`, pairwise disjoint, with the same union. In the applications `(B i)` is the family
of balls of a `D`-boundedly overlapping cover of `S`, and the conclusion says that every point
of `S ⊆ ⋃ i, B i = ⋃ i, P i` lies in `P i` for exactly one `i`.

This is what lets a cover be used as if it were a partition: it is needed whenever a
construction is carried out separately in each ball and the results have to be amalgamated,
since for a genuine cover the pieces belonging to overlapping balls interfere.

The statement is for an arbitrary finite family rather than for balls, and it is existential:
the blueprint exhibits the pieces `B_{i_k} \ ⋃_{l < k} B_{i_l}` for a chosen enumeration of
`s`, but nothing downstream depends on that choice. -/

/-! ### Covers produced by a maximal separated set

Throughout this section a subset `N` of a metric space is *`r`-separated* when
`r ≤ dist y z` for all distinct `y, z ∈ N`, and it is a *maximal* `r`-separated subset of `S`
when moreover `N ⊆ S` and every point of `S` is at distance `< r` from some point of `N` —
equivalently, no point of `S` can be added to `N` keeping `r`-separation. Both conditions are
spelled out inline rather than through `Metric.IsSeparated`, whose convention is the *strict*
inequality `r < dist y z`, and through `Metric.IsCover`, which uses closed balls. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:separatedNetCover`**.

The overlap constant `5 ^ n` of the two covers built from a maximal separated set in
dimension `n`; it arises from a volume comparison between balls of radius `r / 2` and

/-- **Cardinality of a separated set in a ball**.

An `r`-separated subset of a ball of radius `R` is finite of cardinality at most
`(1 + 2R/r) ^ n`; in particular `|N| ≲ 1` when `R ≲ r`. The proof compares the volumes of the
disjoint balls `B(y, r/2)`, `y ∈ N`, all contained in `B(x₀, R + r/2)`.

The hypothesis `0 ≤ R` cannot be dropped: for `R < -r/2` the ball is empty, so `N` is empty,
while the bound `(1 + 2R/r) ^ n` is negative in odd dimensions. The repository's
`Metric.packingNumber_mul_pow_le_volume_cthickening` thickens by `r` where the disjoint balls
have radius `r/2`, so it yields only `(2 + 2R/r) ^ n`; the sharp constant needs the direct
volume comparison. -/

/-- **Overlap of the balls at a separated set**.

For an `r`-separated set `N` and a radius `t ≤ 2r`, no point lies in more than
`separatedNetCoverConstant n` of the balls `B(y, t)`, `y ∈ N`: the relevant centres lie in
`B(x, t) ⊆ B(x, 2r)` and are `r`-separated, so `finite_and_card_le_of_separated` with `R = 2r`
bounds their number by `(1 + 4) ^ n = 5 ^ n`. -/

/-- **Existence of a finite maximal separated set**.

A bounded set `S` has a finite maximal `r`-separated subset. Maximality is stated in the form
actually used downstream — every point of `S` is at distance `< r` from a point of the net —
which for `r > 0` is equivalent to the impossibility of adding a point of `S`.

In Lean the net is produced by `Metric.maximalSeparatedSet`, whose side condition
`Metric.packingNumber r S ≠ ⊤` follows for bounded `S` from the repository's
`Bornology.IsBounded.coveringNumber_ne_top`; two conventions have to be reconciled, since
`Metric.IsSeparated` uses the strict inequality and `Metric.IsCover` closed balls. -/

/-- **A maximal separated set covers at radius `r`**.

The balls `B(y, r)`, `y ∈ N`, are a `separatedNetCoverConstant n`-boundedly overlapping cover
of `S`: the covering is maximality, and the overlap bound is `card_filter_ball_le` with
`t = r`. -/

/-- **A maximal separated set covers the `r`-neighbourhood at radius `2r`**.

If `x` is within `< r` of a point `x' ∈ S` and `x'` is within `< r` of `y ∈ N`, then `x` is
within `< 2r` of `y`; the overlap bound is `card_filter_ball_le` with `t = 2r`.

The neighbourhood is the *open* one, `Metric.thickening`: for the closed neighbourhood the
statement is false at radius `2r`, as the example `S = (1, 2]`, `r = 1`, `N = {2}`, `x = 0`
shows. Statements phrased with `Metric.cthickening` must therefore either enlarge the radius
or first pass to a strictly larger open neighbourhood. -/

/-- **Covers produced by a maximal separated set**.

The statement cited downstream: a bounded set `S` has a finite maximal `r`-separated subset
`N`, and for any such `N`, writing `C = separatedNetCoverConstant n`,

* the balls `B(y, r)`, `y ∈ N`, are a `C`-boundedly overlapping cover of `S`;
* the balls `B(y, 2r)`, `y ∈ N`, are a `C`-boundedly overlapping cover of the open
  neighbourhood `N_r(S)`;
* the balls `B(y, r/2)`, `y ∈ N`, are pairwise disjoint;
* if `S ⊆ B(x₀, R)` with `0 ≤ R` then `|N| ≤ (1 + 2R/r) ^ n`.

It merely assembles the five preceding lemmas. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:massSubball`**.

For an ambient dimension `n` and a ratio bound `K ≥ 1` between the diameter scale of the set
and the radius of the subball, this is `(1 + 2K)⁻¹ ^ n ∈ (0, 1]`, the reciprocal of the
cardinality bound of blueprint `lem:separatedNetCard`. -/

/-- **A subball carrying a proportional share of the mass**.

A measurable set `S` contained in a ball of radius `R ≤ Kρ` has a point `y ∈ S` with
`|S ∩ B(y, ρ)| ≥ massSubballConstant n K · |S|`: the balls at a maximal `ρ`-separated subset
`M ⊆ S` cover `S` and `|M| ≤ (1 + 2K) ^ n`, so one of the at most `(1 + 2K) ^ n` terms of
`∑_{y ∈ M} |S ∩ B(y, ρ)| ≥ |S|` is large.

The point `y` is a point of `S` itself, which is what the transverse case uses. No
measurability of `S` is needed: the covering step is subadditivity of the outer measure. -/
