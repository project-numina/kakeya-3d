# Multiplicity bounds at an ambient radius `R > 1`

The `b`-scale plank tubes of the coarse endgame do **not** lie in the unit ball, and cannot be
made to: a `Kakeya.Tube` has core length exactly `1`, so a tube attached to a plank that hugs
`∂B₁` necessarily pokes out.  What `Kakeya.ml1Boot.plankTube_carrier_subset_closedBall` gives is
containment in `closedBall 0 (3/2 + √3 + C b)`, and `3/2 + √3 > 1` is not slack.

Every consumer of those tubes, however, only ever uses the unit-ball hypothesis to feed the
family to a *multiplicity upper bound* stated in `B₁`.  This file supplies the missing reduction:
an upper bound valid for families in `B₁` upgrades, at a dimensional constant, to one valid for
families in `B_R` for any `δ`-independent `R ≥ 1`.

## The reduction

Three steps, none of which moves the tubes:

1. **Discard the sparsely shaded tubes** (`_root_.ShadedBody.discardLowShading` at level `1/2`).  What
   survives carries half the shade mass, so the multiplicity of the whole is at most twice that
   of the survivors, and — this is the point — *every* member of the survivors has shade density
   at least `λ / 2`, hence so does every subfamily of it.  This is what makes the fullness
   hypothesis descend to the cells of step 2, which it does not do without the discard.
2. **Cut `B_R` into `O(1)` cells.**  `Kakeya.StickyKakeya.exists_ball_assignment` provides a
   finite set `xs` of centres, depending only on `R`, such that every `b`-tube in `B_R` with
   `b ≤ 1/4` lies in `closedBall x 1` for some `x ∈ xs`.  Assigning each tube such a centre
   partitions the index set, and `Kakeya.ml1Boot.multiplicity_le_sum_fiberwise` bounds the
   multiplicity of the whole by the sum of the cells' multiplicities.
3. **Translate each cell into `B₁`** and apply the hypothesis there.  Multiplicity, fullness and
   `maxDensity` are all translation invariant (`ShadedBody.multiplicity_translate_const`,
   `ShadedBody.fullness_translate_const`, `Kakeya.StickyKakeya.maxDensity_tube_translate`), so
   nothing has to be carried back by hand.

The total loss is `2 * xs.card`, a constant fixed before the scale, which the consumers absorb
into their subpolynomial factor.

## The plank-width side condition

Step 2 needs `b ≤ 1/4`.  On the Section 8 route the `b`-tube scale is
`Kakeya.ml1Boot.plankPigeonhole.C * bp` with `bp ≤ 2 * δ̃ ^ (6 ε)`, so the condition is bought
from the eventually-filter: `Kakeya.ml1Boot.eventually_mul_two_rpow_le`.  This is also exactly
the hypothesis `hbq1` of the two `b`-tube producers, and
`Kakeya.ml1Boot.plankTube_carrier_subset_closedBall_of_le` reads the same condition to place the
tubes in `closedBall 0 (9/2)`; the three demands coincide and are discharged together.

## Main statements

* `Kakeya.ml1Boot.eventually_nnreal_rpow_le`, `Kakeya.ml1Boot.eventually_mul_two_rpow_le`: the
  plank-width side condition, bought from the filter;
* `Kakeya.ml1Boot.multiplicity_le_sum_fiberwise`: multiplicity is subadditive along a partition
  of the index set;
* `Kakeya.ml1Boot.multiplicity_le_of_ball_of_unitBall`: the reduction itself.

/-- **Multiplicity is subadditive along a partition of the index set.**

If `g` maps `t` into `xs`, then the multiplicity of `(t, V)` is at most the sum, over `x ∈ xs`,
of the multiplicities of the fibres `{i ∈ t | g i = x}`.

The numerator splits exactly, `∑_{i ∈ t} |Y i| = ∑_{x ∈ xs} ∑_{i ∈ t, g i = x} |Y i|`, while the
denominator only shrinks along a fibre, `|⋃_{fibre} Y| ≤ |⋃_t Y|`, and a smaller denominator makes
a larger quotient.  Nothing is assumed about `V` and no nondegeneracy is needed: in `ENNReal` the
degenerate cases (`0 / 0 = 0`, an empty fibre) come out on the right side of the inequality by
themselves. -/

/-! ### The reduction -/

/-- **A multiplicity upper bound valid in `B₁` upgrades to one valid in `B_R`.**

For a `δ`-independent radius `R ≥ 1` there is a `δ`-independent cardinality `M` — the number of
cells `Kakeya.StickyKakeya.exists_ball_assignment` needs to cover `B_R` — such that the following
holds for every family of shaded `b`-tubes in `B_R` with `b ≤ 1/4`.

Suppose the family has fullness at least `lam`, and suppose `Bound` bounds the multiplicity of
every *nonempty subfamily* that one translation carries into `B₁` and whose fullness is at least
`lam / 2`.  Then the multiplicity of the whole family is at most `2 M * Bound`.

The two halves of the loss are the two pigeonholes: the `2` pays for discarding the sparsely
shaded tubes, which is what makes the fullness hypothesis descend to a subfamily at all, and the
`M` pays for summing over the cells.  Both are fixed before the scale, so a consumer working
inside an eventually-filter absorbs them into its subpolynomial factor.

The hypothesis is stated at `lam / 2` rather than at `lam` because that is exactly what the
discard delivers: every retained tube has shade density at least `λ(𝕋, Y) / 2 ≥ lam / 2`, and a
family all of whose members have density at least `lam / 2` has fullness at least `lam / 2`
(`Kakeya.ml1Boot.le_fullness_of_dens_lower`) — the step that fails for a bare subfamily and is
the reason the discard cannot be omitted. -/
