# Restricting a `BallDataCore` to a subfamily of its balls

General-branch steps **G4b**. GWZ §9.3 deletes balls twice — the heavy-ball (fullness) cut of GWZ
 and the dimensions pigeonhole of  — and both deletions must be
performed *on the `BallDataCore`*, not merely on an abstract ball index set, because
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.toBallData` reads every (C4) clause on `core.bs` while the
producers of those clauses (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_dimsClass_heavy`) deliver them only on
a subset `bs' ⊆ core.bs`.

## Why this file exists and `tierCore` cannot do its work

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tierCore` refines the *segments* and **copies the ball set**
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tierCore_bs : (tierCore …).bs = core.bs`); its `hne` binder
(`∀ B ∈ core.bs, (tier B).Nonempty`) in fact *forbids* emptying a ball's tier, so it cannot be
repurposed as a ball deletion. This file supplies the missing operation.

## The construction

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.restrictBalls` takes `bs' ⊆ core.bs`, its non-emptiness, and
a **retention factor** `K` with

  `K⁻¹ ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |Y_g(T)| ≤ ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |Y_g(T) ∩ ⋃_{B ∈ bs'} B̂|`,

and returns a `BallDataCore` with `bs := bs'` and the working shading

  `Y_g'(T) = Y_g(T) ∩ ⋃_{B ∈ bs'} B̂`  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.restrictYg`),

at the **explicit** loss `Cg' = Cg · K`. There is no `Cm` factor: unlike the tier, this
refinement does not change the segments and so never passes through
`Kakeya.ThinCase.lift`; the fibre count is unchanged because on the shading of a segment of a
*retained* ball the two fibres are literally the same `Finset`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.restrictYg_fibre_filter_eq`, the device of `BallTierCore` §4.1).

Everything except `P_cover`, `back`, `fibre` and `Yg_mass` is inherited by restriction along
`bs' ⊆ core.bs`. The four that are not:

* `P_cover` becomes trivial — the new shading is by construction inside `⋃_{B ∈ bs'} B̂`;
* `back` needs the retained ball's own piece: for `p ∈ segs B` with `B ∈ bs'`, `Y_B(p) ⊆ B̂`
  (`Y_piece`) already puts the shade in `⋃_{B ∈ bs'} B̂`, so intersecting `Y_g` with that union
  loses nothing on `Y_B(p)`;
* `fibre` is the filter identity above;
* `Yg_mass` is the input `hret` composed with `core.Yg_mass`.

## The retention is a mass identity, not an estimate

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ballYgMass core B = ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |Y_g(T) ∩ B̂|` is the per-ball working mass.
Because the pieces are pairwise disjoint and measurable and cover `Y_g`,

  `∑_{T} |Y_g'(T)| = ∑_{B ∈ bs'} ballYgMass core B`   and
  `∑_{T} |Y_g(T)| = ∑_{B ∈ 𝔅} ballYgMass core B`

(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.sum_volume_restrictYg_eq_sum_ballYgMass`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.sum_volume_Yg_eq_sum_ballYgMass`), so
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.restrictYg_mass_of_retention` converts a retention stated on the *ball*
mass functional — which is the shape `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_dimsClass_heavy` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_heavyBalls_at` deliver — into the `hret` binder verbatim. This is
the bridge G5 consumes; without it the pigeonhole's `∑ B ∈ bs', Sm B` output does not meet the
structure's `∑ i ∈ cfg.s` input.
