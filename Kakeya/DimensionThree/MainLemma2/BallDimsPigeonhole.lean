# The dimensions pigeonhole: fixing `(a, b)` across the balls after the per-ball factoring

General-branch steps G4. GWZ §9.3: "by pigeonholing, we can suppose that for each `B`, the convex sets `W ∈ 𝕎_B` have
dimensions `a × b × r₁`". The per-ball factoring
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_ballFactoring_core`, G2) already gives, *inside* one ball, the
comparability of the whole thickness profile of its bodies at Lemma 9.2's `δ`-free constant
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lemma92Constant cfg.ϱ` (its clause `simDims`, GWZ Lemma 9.2's last
assertion "each of approximately the same dimensions"). What is missing is a **single** pair
`(a, b)` valid across the balls, and that is bought by a pigeonhole: the two short thicknesses
of a ball are rounded to a geometric class of ratio `ρ > 1`, the class carrying the most
retained mass is kept, and the other balls are dropped.

## Contents

* `scaleClass`, `scaleValue`: the ratio-`ρ` geometric class of a positive real and its
  representative value, with the two-sided spec `scaleValue (scaleClass x) / ρ < x ≤
  scaleValue (scaleClass x)` and antitonicity of the class.
* `exists_maxMass_fiber`: the pigeonhole itself — a label with at most `N` values has a fibre
  carrying at least `N⁻¹` of the total mass.
* `bodyMinThickness`: the smallest `k`-thickness among the bodies of one ball (defined through
  `Metric.ethickness`, so that `Finset.inf` is total), with its attainment and lower bound.
* `dimsConstant C₀ ρ CF = max C₀ (ρ * CF)`: the thickness-comparison constant the pigeonhole
  delivers, and `dimsClassLoss ρ δ = (⌊log_ρ (1/δ)⌋₊ + 1) ^ 2`: the **explicit** pigeonhole
  loss (two classes, each with `⌊log_ρ (1/δ)⌋₊ + 1` values). It is polylogarithmic:
  `dimsClassLoss_le_polylog` bounds it by `(1 + log_ρ (1/δ)) ^ 2` and
  `eventually_dimsClassLoss_le_rpow` absorbs it into `δ ^ (-ε)` for every `ε > 0`.
* **`exists_dimsClass`**: the pigeonhole, on abstract per-ball body data in the shape
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.toBallData` reads. Output: `(a, b)` with
  `δ ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r₁`, a retained ball set `bs'` carrying `dimsClassLoss⁻¹` of the mass, the
  binder `bodies_thickness` at `dimsConstant C₀ ρ CF` on every body of every retained ball,
  and — under the budget `ρ * CF ≤ 4` — a `w₁` with `δ ≤ w₁ ≤ 2 r₁` satisfying the factor-2
  window `bodies_w₁`.
* `bodyProfile_of_core`: the two profile inputs of `exists_dimsClass` (the long thickness
  bounded below by `C₀⁻¹ r₁`, the short one bounded below by `δ`) derived from the
  `BallDataCore` fields `segs_thickness` and `segs_scale` through `segs_le`.
* `exists_dimsClass_core`: the two combined on a `BallDataCore`, with the profile stated
  against `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.withDims cfg a b hdims` — literally the `bodies_thickness`
  binder of `toBallData` for the transported configuration, which a tripwire `example`
  records.
* `exists_heavyBalls`, `exists_heavyBalls_at`: the *other* ball deletion of GWZ §9.3 — the
  fullness cut, which keeps the balls carrying the per-ball fullness at half the
  global threshold and half of the shade mass. On the balls it discards the per-ball fullness is
  genuinely false, so this too can only ever be a property of a retained ball set.
* **`exists_dimsClass_heavy`**: the two deletions composed in the only admissible order —
  fullness cut first, dims class second — at the single explicit loss
  `Cg₂ = 2 * dimsClassLoss ρ δ`. A per-ball property of the input ball set survives the second
  deletion because it passes to a subset; the reverse order retains nothing.

## What this does not do

It does not restrict the core to the retained ball set `bs'` (the `(C2)`/`(C5)` clauses on
fewer balls, with the matching cut of the working shading `Yg` — G3/G5's `tierCore`), it does
not glue the per-ball bodies of G2 into one `Wb` on a shared index type, and it asserts nothing
about essential distinctness of a ball's bodies — the field that once carried that assertion,
`BallData.bodies_essDistinct`, no longer exists, statement question R26 having deleted it. The
selection order is GWZ's and the
plan's §2.3: the class is chosen **after** the factoring and deletes whole *balls*, never
members of a block, so `frostman`, `biasedDensity` and `bodies_antiClustering` are read on
exactly Lemma 9.2's blocks. -/

/-- **The dimensions pigeonhole** (GWZ §9.3 ).

Input, per ball `B ∈ bs` and per body `j ∈ bodies B` — exactly the shape
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.toBallData` reads, and exactly what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_ballFactoring_core` delivers on one ball:

* `hball` — the bodies sit in the ball of radius `r₁` (its clause `bodies_subset_ball`);
* `hlong`, `hscale` — the longest thickness is at least `C₀⁻¹ r₁` and the shortest is at least
  `δ`, both coming from a segment inside the body (`bodyProfile_of_core`);
* `hsim` — within one ball the whole thickness profile is comparable at `CF` (Lemma 9.2's
  `simDims` clause).

Output: a pair `(a, b)` with `δ ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r₁`, a retained ball set `bs'` carrying at least
the fraction `(dimsClassLoss ρ δ)⁻¹` of the mass, the binder `bodies_thickness` at
`dimsConstant C₀ ρ CF` for every body of every retained ball, and — **under the budget
`ρ CF ≤ 4`** — a common shortest dimension `w₁` with `δ ≤ w₁ ≤ 2 r₁` satisfying the factor-2
window `bodies_w₁`.

The budget is where the `w₁` window is paid for: the retained bodies' shortest thicknesses
span a factor `ρ CF` (the class rounding times the within-ball comparability), while the window
`[w₁/2, 2 w₁]` spans a factor `4`. The thickness profile itself needs no budget.

Only whole *balls* are dropped, never members of a block: that is what keeps the per-block
clauses of the factoring (`frostman`, `biasedDensity`, `bodies_antiClustering`) readable on
exactly Lemma 9.2's blocks, and it is the order GWZ use. -/

/-- **The two profile inputs of `exists_dimsClass`, from the core.** A body containing a segment
inherits the segment's lower thickness bounds:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.segs_thickness` gives `C₀⁻¹ r₁` at the long end and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.segs_scale` gives the constant-free `δ` at the short end.

The hypothesis `hinhab` — every body is the block of some retained segment — is a property of
the factoring's partition that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_ballFactoring_core` does not
currently expose among its conclusions; it is passed in here rather than assumed away. -/

/-! ### The fullness cut: deleting the balls GWZ discard -/

/-- **The heavy-ball cut** (GWZ §9.3: `𝔅` is the family of balls on which
`λ(𝕋_B, Y_B) ⪆ δ^η`).

Given the fullness of the whole family at `α` — `α ∑_B C B ≤ ∑_B S B`, with `C B` the carrier
mass and `S B` the shade mass of the ball `B` — the balls on which the *per-ball* fullness holds
at `α / 2` carry at least half of the shade mass. The threshold has to drop by a factor `2`
(Markov): on the discarded balls the per-ball fullness is genuinely false, which is why it can
only ever be a property of a *retained* ball set and never a field. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lemma92Constant ϱ = 2 * 384 ^ ϱ` (`Metric.volume_comparison.C 3 = 384`),
so `ρ CF ≤ 4` at `ρ = 3/2` amounts to `384 ^ ϱ ≤ 4/3`, i.e. to `384 ≤ (4/3) ^ 21` — a `norm_num`
fact — as soon as `ϱ ≤ 1/21`. Since `Kakeya.VNSUniform.CaseParams.slabBias` reads
`2 ^ 20 * ϱ < exscal`, any admissible parameter set with `exscal ≤ 2 ^ 20 / 21` satisfies it with
room to spare, so the budget is not a restriction on the construction. -/
