# Wiring the polylog absorber: the cardinality discharge and the relative-scale change of variable

What that payoff still carries is

* a **cardinality hypothesis** `hN : ∀ d, 0 < d → d ≤ 1 → (N d : ℝ) ≤ (1/d)^p`, which
   measured to be *half the blocker* rather than a detail: `L`'s first factor is
  `1 + logb 2 (card · X^ϖ)`, so with `card` unbounded there is no `δ`-free slope and **no absorber
  of any degree can work**;
* a **scale mismatch**: Lemma 9.2's retention is read at the relative scale `d = δ/r₁`, while the
  `Cg` obligation is stated at `δ`.

## O2 — the cardinality discharge

The existing `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_card_segs_le`
(`M/ThinConstantProducer.lean`) proves `#(bd.segs B) ≤ 1 · δ⁻¹^4` eventually, i.e. `p = 4`. It is
**eventual in `δ` and quantified over `cfg`, `bd`, `B` inside the filter**, whereas `hN` is a
*pointwise, `cfg`-free* hypothesis on a single function `N : NNReal → ℕ`. The two shapes do not
meet, and no choice of `N` bridges them, because `#(bd.segs B)` is not a function of `δ` alone.

The fix is to move the `∀ n` inside the filter. Nothing in the absorber's eventual step mentions
the cardinality: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.uniformLossBound_le_polylog_pow` is *pointwise* in `d`, and
only `(A + B · logb 2 (1/d))^k ≤ d^{-ε}` is eventual. Factoring at that seam gives
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_uniformLossBound_le_rpow_neg_of_card`, which is **uniform in the
cardinality** and therefore composes with the existing count by `filter_upwards`.

## O3 — the change of variable `d = δ/r₁ → δ`

 supplied **both** adapters and this file uses **exactly those two**, writing no
third:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT` turns the absorber's `∀ᶠ` into an
  explicit threshold, which is what a *derived* scale needs — used inside
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_of_relScale`;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_rpow_neg_of_le_coarser` transports a `c^{-ε}` bound to `d^{-ε}` for
  `d ≤ c`, applied at `c = δ/r₁ ≥ δ` — used inside
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_uniformLossBound_relScale_le_rpow_neg`.

What  item 3 left as "a `cfg`-level fact, not an analytic one" is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_relScale_le`: with `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` and `exscal < 1`,
`δ/r₁ = δ^{1 - exscal} → 0`, which the existing
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_nnreal_mul_rpow_le_rpow` supplies at `p = 1 - exscal`, `q = 0`.

One further piece the obligation list did not name: the count is known **at `δ`** while the loss
is read **at `δ/r₁`**, and `δ/r₁ ≥ δ` makes `δ^{-4}` the *weaker* bound in the relative variable.
The honest relative exponent is therefore `4/(1 - exscal)`, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.inv_rpow_relScale` is the exact identity
`((δ/r₁)⁻¹)^{p/(1-exscal)} = (δ⁻¹)^p`, not an inequality — no slack is spent.

## What this does **not** do

It does **not** close `bd.Cg ≤ δ^{-εg}`, and cannot: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_ballData_general`
does not exist,
and the existing conjunct 1 of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SideDataObligations` still reads `bd.Cg = Cg`
at a `δ`-free `Cg`. There is no consumer to close against. See

/-! ### O2: the absorber's eventual step, separated from the cardinality -/

/-- **The absorber's eventual step, with no cardinality in sight.** A degree-`k` polylog in the
normal form `A + B · logb 2 (1/d)` is eventually below `d^{-ε}`, as an `ENNReal.ofReal`.

This is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog_pow` at the *maximal* admissible
`f`, namely `f d = ((A + B · logb 2 (1/d))^k).toNNReal`; the hypothesis `hf` of the absorber then
holds with **equality** on `(0, 1]`, because `hA`, `hB` and `d ≤ 1` force the bracket
non-negative, so `Real.toNNReal` truncates nothing. Every later consumer factors through this and
therefore never has to re-run the `𝓝[>]0 ⇄ atTop` transfer.

`hA : 0 ≤ A` and `hB : 0 ≤ B` are the absorber's own hypotheses and are load-bearing twice over:
they license the linearisation inside the absorber, and here they are what makes the truncation
vacuous. `hε : 0 < ε` is what makes `d^{-ε}` beat a fixed power of a logarithm. -/

/-- **O2, the reusable half: the loss bound is absorbed uniformly in the cardinality.**

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_uniformLossBound_le_rpow_neg` takes the cardinality control as a
*pointwise* hypothesis on a function `N : NNReal → ℕ` of the scale alone. The existing count
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_card_segs_le` is not of that shape and cannot be made so:
`#(bd.segs B)` depends on `cfg`, `bd` and `B`, all of which the existing statement quantifies
*inside* the filter. Here the `∀ n` is moved inside the filter instead, which is sound precisely
because the absorber's eventual step
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_ofReal_polylog_pow_le_rpow_neg`) does not mention `n` at all:
the `n`-dependence is entirely inside the pointwise
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.uniformLossBound_le_polylog_pow`.

Which hypothesis forces what. `hε : 0 < ε` is the only hypothesis, and it is exactly the
absorber's. `p` is free: it is *not* a hypothesis but a parameter of the conclusion, and it is
where the caller's cardinality exponent enters (`p = 4` from the existing count, at the absolute
scale). `dim` is free. No sign condition on `ϖ` is needed —  deleted that binder
rather than renaming it, and this lemma inherits the generality. -/

/-! ### O3: the relative scale `δ/r₁` -/

/-- `δ/r₁ = δ^{1 - exscal}` for `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` and `δ > 0`. `hδ` is what licenses
`NNReal.rpow_sub`; at `δ = 0` the left side is `0/0 = 0` and the right side is `0`, so the
identity happens to survive, but the *proof* does not, and no consumer needs `δ = 0`. -/
theorem relScale_eq {δ : ℝ≥0} (hδ : 0 < δ) (exscal : ℝ) :
    δ / δ ^ exscal = δ ^ (1 - exscal) := by
  rw [NNReal.rpow_sub hδ.ne', NNReal.rpow_one]

/-- **The relative scale tends to `0`.**  item 3 named this as the one remaining
piece of the change of variable and classified it correctly as `cfg`-level rather than analytic:
`δ/r₁ = δ^{1-exscal}`, and `exscal < 1` makes the exponent positive, so the existing
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_nnreal_mul_rpow_le_rpow` applies at `p = 1 - exscal`, `q = 0`
with the constant `d₀⁻¹`.

`hex1 : exscal < 1` is the hypothesis forcing everything: at `exscal = 1` the relative scale is
identically `1` and the statement is false for `d₀ < 1`; at `exscal > 1` it diverges. `hd₀`
forces `d₀ ≠ 0` for the final division. -/
theorem eventually_relScale_le {exscal : ℝ} (hex1 : exscal < 1) {d₀ : ℝ≥0} (hd₀ : 0 < d₀) :
    ∀ᶠ δ : ℝ≥0 in 𝓝[>] 0, δ / δ ^ exscal ≤ d₀ := by

/-- The relative scale is positive, so it lies in the punctured neighbourhood the absorber's
threshold is stated on. -/
theorem eventually_relScale_pos {exscal : ℝ} :
    ∀ᶠ δ : ℝ≥0 in 𝓝[>] 0, (0 : ℝ≥0) < δ / δ ^ exscal := by
  filter_upwards [self_mem_nhdsWithin] with δ hδ0
  have hδ : (0 : ℝ≥0) < δ := by simpa using hδ0
  exact div_pos hδ (NNReal.rpow_pos hδ)

/-- **The change of variable `δ ↦ δ/r₁`, as a filter statement.** Anything that holds eventually
in the punctured neighbourhood of `0` holds eventually at the *relative* scale.

This is where 's first adapter
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT` is used, and it is used for the
reason its docstring gives: `∀ᶠ c in 𝓝[>] 0` is the wrong shape for a *derived* scale, since one
cannot `filter_upwards` along a substitution. Converting to an explicit threshold `d₀` first, and
then reaching `d₀` with `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_relScale_le`, is the whole proof.

`hex1 : exscal < 1` is inherited from `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_relScale_le` and is the
only hypothesis; note in particular that `0 ≤ exscal` is **not** needed here (it is needed only by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_relScale`, for the transport back). -/
theorem eventually_of_relScale {exscal : ℝ} (hex1 : exscal < 1) {P : ℝ≥0 → Prop}

  exact hP _ hpos hle

/-- `δ ≤ δ/r₁`: the relative scale is the **coarser** one, which is what makes
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_rpow_neg_of_le_coarser` applicable in the direction needed.

`hδ1 : δ ≤ 1` and `hex0 : 0 ≤ exscal` together give `r₁ = δ^{exscal} ≤ 1`; both do work, since at
`δ > 1` or `exscal < 0` one has `r₁ > 1` and the inequality reverses. `hδ` licenses the division.
For an actual `cfg` these are `cfg.hδ1` and `cfg.hexscal.le`. -/
theorem le_relScale {δ : ℝ≥0} (hδ : 0 < δ) (hδ1 : δ ≤ 1) {exscal : ℝ} (hex0 : 0 ≤ exscal) :

/-- **The exact exponent identity behind the change of variable.**
`((δ/r₁)⁻¹)^{p/(1-exscal)} = (δ⁻¹)^p`, an *equality*, not an inequality: passing the cardinality
bound from the absolute scale to the relative one costs nothing, provided the exponent is
rescaled by `1/(1 - exscal)`.

This is the piece 's obligation list did not name. The count is known at `δ`
(`#segs B ≤ δ^{-4}`) while the loss is read at `δ/r₁ ≥ δ`, so `δ^{-4}` is the *weaker* bound in
the relative variable and the honest relative exponent is `4/(1 - exscal)`, not `4`.

`hex1 : exscal < 1` forces `1 - exscal ≠ 0`, without which the rescaled exponent does not exist;
`hδ` is needed for `relScale_eq`. -/

/-- **O2 + O3 composed, at general `dim` and general cardinality exponent.** The uniformised
Lemma 9.2 loss read at the **relative** scale `δ/r₁`, under a cardinality bound stated at the
**absolute** scale `δ`, is eventually below `δ^{-ε}` for every `ε > 0`.

Both of 's adapters are used here and no third was written: the change of variable
is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_of_relScale` (built on adapter 1,
`exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT`), and the transport of the conclusion from `(δ/r₁)^{-ε}`
back to `δ^{-ε}` is adapter 2, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_rpow_neg_of_le_coarser`, applied at
`c = δ/r₁`, `d = δ` — legitimate exactly because `δ ≤ δ/r₁`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_relScale`).

Which hypothesis forces what.

* `hex0 : 0 ≤ exscal` is used **only** by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_relScale`, i.e. only to know
  that the relative scale is the coarser one. It cannot be dropped: at `exscal < 0` the ball
  radius exceeds `1`, `δ/r₁ < δ`, and adapter 2 runs the wrong way.
* `hex1 : exscal < 1` is used **twice**: by `eventually_of_relScale` (the relative scale must tend
  to `0`) and by `inv_rpow_relScale` (the rescaled exponent must exist).
* `hε : 0 < ε` is the absorber's.
* `p` is a free parameter of the conclusion, not a hypothesis. It appears in the *absolute*
  variable; the lemma rescales it to `p/(1 - exscal)` internally.

For an actual `cfg` with `cfg.exscal = exscal`, `hex0` is `cfg.hexscal.le`; `hex1` is the
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` field `scale : exscal < 1/2`. The `exscal` binder must sit
*outside* the filter because `cfg` is quantified *inside* it — that quantifier order is the
existing convention (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinConstantObligation_of_card_bodies`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_C₀_mul_le_half_r₁`), which is why `hex0` cannot simply be read
off `cfg`. -/
