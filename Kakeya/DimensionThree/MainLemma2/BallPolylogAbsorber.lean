# The degree-`k` polylogarithmic absorber

Both reviews measured the same gap:

* `ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization.L` (`Kakeya/Factorization.lean`) is a
  **product** of `dim + 1` polylogarithmic factors,
  `ofReal (1 + logb 2 (card · (2^dim/(c·d^dim))^ϖ)) * ofReal (1 + logb 2 (1/d)) ^ dim`
  — at `dim = 3` a degree-4 polylog product;
* the existing absorber `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog`
  (`M/BallGeneralGlue.lean`) takes an **additive** hypothesis
  `(f d : ℝ) ≤ A + B · logb 2 (1/d)` — degree 1.

So `Cg ≤ δ^{-ε}` had no route, for **any** `ε > 0`: the defect is exponent-independent.

This file supplies the missing degree-`k` absorber and the reduction that makes it usable on
Lemma 9.2's loss. Nothing existing changes; every declaration here is new.

## Contents

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.polylog_pow_rpow_atTop` — the degree-`k` generalisation of the existing
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.polylog_rpow_atTop`, which hard-wires the exponent `2`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog_pow` — **the absorber**. A
  `NNReal`-valued function of the scale bounded by `(A + B · logb 2 (1/d)) ^ k` is eventually
  below `δ^{-ε}`, for every `ε > 0` and every `k`. It sits **beside** the existing additive
  absorber and **subsumes** it: `eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog_of_pow` is the `k = 1`
  instance, and it reproves the existing statement verbatim.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog_prod` — the same for a function
  bounded by a `Finset.prod` of `k` individually-polylog factors, which is the shape `L` has.
* `ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization.L_le_polylog_pow` — the reduction of `L` at
  general `dim` to a degree-`(dim + 1)` polylog power. **Every constant is forced**: see the
  docstring for which hypothesis pins which.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_uniformLossBound_le_rpow_neg` and its `dim = 3` instance
  `…_three_le_rpow_neg` — the payoff:
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.uniformLossBound 3 (N δ) δ ϱ ≤ δ^{-ε}` eventually, for every `ε > 0`,
  whenever the cardinality bound `N` is polynomially bounded in `1/δ`. The existing
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_card_segs_le` supplies exactly that, at `p = 4`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.le_rpow_neg_of_le_coarser` — the two shape adapters, kept separate from
  the absorber: Lemma 9.2's retention is read at the *relative* scale `δ/r₁` while the `Cg`
  obligation is stated at `δ`.

## What this does **not** do

A product of polylogarithmic losses is absorbed by any fixed negative power of `δ`.

/-! ### The degree-`k` polylogarithmic growth bound -/

/-- **`(1 + logb ρ x) ^ k = o(x^ε)` for every `k` and every `ε > 0`.** The existing
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.polylog_rpow_atTop` is the `k = 2` case; it hard-wires the exponent `2`
because its only consumer squared. The reduction to it is monotonicity of `t ↦ t ^ n` at a base
`t = 1 + logb ρ x ≥ 1`, valid for `x ≥ 1`, together with `k ≤ 2 · max k 1`.

The hypothesis `1 < ρ` is what forces `0 ≤ logb ρ x` for `x ≥ 1` (`Real.logb_nonneg`), hence
`1 ≤ 1 + logb ρ x`, without which `pow_le_pow_right₀` is unavailable and the statement is false
(at `ρ < 1` the polylog is negative and odd powers flip). -/

/-! ### The scale-side transfer, factored out -/

/-- **The `𝓝[>] 0` ⇄ `atTop` transfer of the absorber, with the growth bound abstracted.** This
is verbatim the tail of the existing `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog`,
extracted so that every polylogarithmic shape — additive, `k`-th power, or product — reaches
`δ^{-ε}` through one bridge instead of its own copy.

`hf` is asked only on `0 < d ≤ 1` because that is all the filter supplies: the threshold
`x₀` produced by `hg` is raised to `max x₀ 1 ≥ 1`, which forces `d ≤ 1` on the selected
neighbourhood. No sign hypothesis on `ε` is needed here; positivity of `ε` is what the *growth
bound* `hg` needs, not the transfer. -/

/-! ### The degree-`k` absorber -/

/-- **THE DEGREE-`k` ABSORBER.** A `NNReal`-valued function of the scale bounded by the `k`-th
power of a polylogarithm, `(f d : ℝ) ≤ (A + B · logb 2 (1/d)) ^ k`, is eventually below
`δ^{-ε}` — for **every** `ε > 0` and **every** `k`.

This is what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData`'s `Cg` field needs and what the existing additive
absorber `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog` could not deliver: Lemma 9.2's
retention `ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization.L` is a *product* of `dim + 1`
polylogarithmic factors, so at `dim = 3` the consumer needs `k = 4`.

Which hypothesis forces which constant:

* `hA : 0 ≤ A`, `hB : 0 ≤ B` force the linearisation inside
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.polylog_normal_pow_rpow_atTop`. They are not cosmetic: for `A < 0` the
  bracket is negative near `d = 1` and an even `k` turns the bound the wrong way round.
* `hε : 0 < ε` is what makes `x ^ ε` beat every fixed power of a logarithm; at `ε = 0` the
  statement is false for any `B > 0`, `k ≥ 1`.
* `k` is unconstrained — in particular `k = 0` is allowed and gives `f d ≤ 1` absorbed trivially.
* `hf` is asked only on `0 < d ≤ 1`, all the filter supplies. -/

and its statement is verbatim that of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog`;
the two therefore sit beside each other, the existing one being an instance rather than a
competitor. Nothing existing is deleted or re-proved in place. -/

/-! ### Lemma 9.2's loss is a degree-`(dim + 1)` polylogarithmic power -/

namespace ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization

/-- **The reduction of Lemma 9.2's retention to the absorber's normal form.**
`ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization.L dim card d ϖ` is a product of `dim + 1`
polylogarithmic factors; each of them is below one common affine polylog `A + B · logb 2 (1/d)`,
so the whole product is below its `(dim + 1)`-st power. That is exactly the hypothesis of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_le_rpow_neg_of_polylog_pow`.

**Which hypothesis forces which constant.** The three factors contributing are
`logb 2 card`, the `δ`-free `ϖ · logb 2 (2^dim / c dim)`, and `ϖ · dim · logb 2 (1/d)`:

* `hcard : (card : ℝ) ≤ (1/d) ^ p` is the *only* control on the cardinality, and it is what
  contributes the `p` in `hB`. Without it `card` is unbounded and no `δ`-free `B` exists —
  the bound is genuinely false, not merely unprovable.
* `hA` pins `A` from the scale-free part of the first factor. `Metric.lt_volume_convexHull.c dim`
  enters through `- logb 2 (c dim)` and `hA1 : 1 ≤ A` is what makes the *second* factor
  `1 + logb 2 (1/d)` fit under the same `A + B · logb 2 (1/d)` (it needs `A ≥ 1`, `B ≥ 1`).
* `hB`, `hB1` pin `B` from `p` (cardinality) plus `ϖ · dim` (the scale part of the first factor)
  and from the second factor's slope `1`.
* there is deliberately **no** sign hypothesis on `ϖ`. One was tried and **deleted**: the whole
  `ϖ`-dependence is carried by `hA` and `hB`, and at `ϖ < 0` the first factor turns negative, so
  `ENNReal.ofReal` truncates it to `0` and the bound holds a fortiori. A `0 ≤ ϖ` binder here did
  no work, and the `unusedVariables` linter said so.
* `hd`, `hd1` force `0 ≤ logb 2 (1/d)`, without which none of the `Λ`-monotonicity steps hold.

At `dim = 3`, the case Lemma 9.2 is read at, this is the required degree-4 statement. -/

/-! ### Two shape adapters the consumer needs

Lemma 9.2's retention is read at the **relative** scale `d = δ/r₁`, not at `δ`, while the `Cg`
obligation is stated at `δ`. The two lemmas below are the change of variable, kept separate from
the absorber so that neither hides inside the other.
-/

/-- **Threshold form of the absorber.** `∀ᶠ d in 𝓝[>] 0` is the wrong shape when the argument is
a *derived* scale `δ/r₁`: one then needs an explicit threshold to compare against. `hd₀1 : d₀ ≤ 1`
is part of the output because every polylog bound here is only claimed on `d ≤ 1`.

*Short-name duplicate, deliberate.* Two other declarations carry this short name —
`Kakeya.StickyKakeya.exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT` (`StickyKakeya/Constants.lean`) and
`Kakeya.ML2Reduction.exists_threshold_of_eventually_nhdsGT`
(`MainLemma2/Reduction/SpineOuterTubes.lean`) — and the full names differ. They are **not**
interchangeable with this one: neither concludes `d₀ ≤ 1`, and the `StickyKakeya` copy binds `δ`
strict-implicitly. -/

/-- **Passing a `δ^{-ε}`-bound from a coarser scale to a finer one.** If a quantity is below
`c^{-ε}` and `d ≤ c ≤ 1`, it is below `d^{-ε}`: the map `t ↦ t^{-ε}` is *antitone*, so the bound
at the *larger* scale is the *stronger* one. This is why the absorber applied at the relative
scale `c = δ/r₁ ≥ δ` still delivers the `Cg` obligation, which is stated at `d = δ`.

`hε : 0 ≤ ε` is what makes the map antitone; at `ε < 0` the implication reverses. `hdc` is the
only other hypothesis: a `0 < d` binder was tried and **deleted**, because at `d = 0` and `ε > 0`
the right-hand side is `⊤` and the statement is vacuously true, so the binder did no work. -/
