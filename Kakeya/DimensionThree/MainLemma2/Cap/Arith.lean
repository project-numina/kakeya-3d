# Exponent bookkeeping of the bilinear broad--narrow cap induction

steps **A1** (§5 row A1; existing here , mathematics identical).

Pure real arithmetic. Nothing here is geometry; these are the budget identities the informal
proof of the Cap Lemma uses, so that the *accounting* is compiler-checked before the geometry
(steps A2--A6) is written.

* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.broad_level` — the broad case at one level. At scale `δ` with `N ≤ δ⁻¹`
  tubes, angular scale `θ = δ^c` and fullness `λ`, the bilinear two-tube bound gives
  `μ ≤ C₃ N δ / (θ λ²)`, and that is `≤ C₃ N^γ δ^{γ-c} λ^{-2}` whenever `c ≤ γ ≤ 1`. So the loss
  against the target `N^γ` is `δ^{γ-c} λ^{-2}`: a **positive** power of the level's scale. This is
  where the cardinality-weighted target `μ ≤ δ^{-ε}|𝕋|^γ` pays the angular loss, and it is exactly
  what fails at `γ = 0` (the plain Kakeya maximal target), since `c ≤ γ` is then impossible.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.exists_depth` — the induction has finite depth `k*` for every accuracy.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.bottom_trivial` — at the bottom level the trivial bound `μ ≤ N` already
  fits inside `δ^{-ε/2}`.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.drift` — a Katz--Tao (or fullness) hypothesis at the fine scale `δ`, read
  at the coarser level scale `δ^a`, is still a hypothesis of the same shape, provided
  `η ≤ a·η_D`; so a single `η := (ε/2)·η_D` serves every level.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.total_loss` — a constant loss per level over `k` levels is absorbed by
  `δ^{-ε/2}` for all `δ ≤ C^{-2k/ε}`.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.recursion_bound` — the downward induction itself: `F k ≤ max A (C·F(k+1))`
  below the bottom, `F K ≤ A`, gives `F 0 ≤ C^K A`.
* `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.gain_is_positive_power` — the sign statement behind `broad_level`: with
  `c ≤ γ` the factor `δ^{γ-c}` is a gain, not a loss.

No `axiom`, `opaque` or `native_decide`; no in-tree import, hence no possible dependence on the
abandoned Wang--Zahl route.

/-- **Broad case at one level.** Scale `δ`, `N ≤ δ⁻¹` tubes, angular scale `θ = δ^c`, fullness
`λ`. The bilinear bound gives `μ ≤ C₃ N δ / (θ λ²)`; this is `≤ C₃ N^γ δ^(γ-c) λ⁻²` whenever
`c ≤ γ ≤ 1`. So the loss against the target `N^γ` is `δ^(γ-c) λ⁻²`, a *positive* power of the
level's scale (times the fullness), not a negative one. -/

/-- The sign statement behind `Kakeya.ML2Cap.Arith.broad_level`: the hypothesis `c ≤ γ` is what
makes the `δ^(γ-c)` factor a *gain* rather than a loss.  (The inequality of `broad_level` is
monotone in the exponents, so it has no strict numerical counterexample at `γ < c`; what fails
there is the accounting, not the inequality.) -/
