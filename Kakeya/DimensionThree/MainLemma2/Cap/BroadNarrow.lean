# The pointwise broad/narrow decomposition of the Cap Lemma (band item A2)

This file sets up the *pointwise* half of the bilinear broad–narrow decomposition used in the
Cap Lemma `L(γ) ⇒ K_KT(γ)` (verified ).
Nothing here is analytic: every statement is a pointwise or finite-combinatorial fact about a
finite family of shaded tubes, plus the measurability of the two counting functions that the
integration step (band item A3) consumes.

## The angular quantity

Tube directions are only defined up to sign (`Tube.reverse` has direction `-d` and the same
carrier), so the angular distance used throughout is

`dirDist u v = min ‖u - v‖ ‖u + v‖`,

which is *exactly* the quantity appearing in `Tube.volume_inter_le_of_angle`
(`Kakeya/Tube/IntersectionVolume.lean`); `dirDist_tube` records that identification. `dirDist` is
symmetric, sign-blind and satisfies the triangle inequality (`dirDist_triangle`), which is all the
decomposition needs.

## The net

`DirNet E θ` bundles what `Tube.sphere_sep_net` produces: a finite set of unit vectors which is
`θ`-separated **in `‖·‖`** and covers the unit sphere within `2 * θ`, again in `‖·‖`.

**Sign convention, measured rather than assumed.** `Tube.sphere_sep_net`
(`Kakeya/Tube/Nets.lean`) is stated with the *plain* norm `‖a - b‖` on both the separation and
the covering clause — it is **not** sign-blind, and its covering radius is `2 * θ`, not `θ`. Both
readings matter:

* the covering clause `‖u - p‖ ≤ 2 * θ` implies `dirDist u p ≤ 2 * θ` (`DirNet.cover_dirDist`),
  so covering transfers to `dirDist` for free;
* the separation clause does **not** transfer: `p` and `-p` may both be net points, and they are
  `2`-separated in `‖·‖` while `dirDist p (-p) = 0`. Hence the packing count of the caps
  (`card_filter_dirDist_le`) is run on the two *sign branches* separately and pays a factor `2`.

Because the cover radius is `2 * θ` rather than `θ`, the cap radius in the broad/narrow split must
be `t + 2 * θ` where `t` is the transversality threshold — this is the constant correction flagged
 ("`sphere_sep_net` is a `θ`-separated `2θ`-net"). All statements below take
the cap radius `r` as a parameter together with the hypothesis `t + 2 * θ ≤ r`, so the caller
fixes the constants.

## The counting functions

`mult s T x` is `m(x) = #{i ∈ s : x ∈ Y_i}` and `multCap s T p r x` is
`m_p(x) = #{i ∈ s : x ∈ Y_i, dirDist (T i).direction p ≤ r}`, both **`ℕ`-valued**. They are
*defined* as finite sums of `Set.indicator`s of the shades rather than as `Finset.filter` cards:
that is what makes `Measurable` immediate (`measurable_mult`, `measurable_multCap`) from
`MeasurableSet (T i).shade`, with no decidability side conditions. `mult_eq_card_filter` is the
bridge to the `Finset.filter` form used by the combinatorics.

## The decomposition

`x` is **narrow** if some net direction captures at least half the shades through `x`, and
**broad** otherwise; `broadSet_eq_compl_narrowSet` records that the two sets partition the space,
and both are measurable.

The main output is `broad_sq_le_two_mul_transverse_pairs`: pointwise on the broad set,
`m(x) ^ 2 ≤ 2 * ∑_{(i,j) transverse} 1_{Y_i ∩ Y_j}(x)`. `enn_broad_sq_le_two_mul_transverse_pairs`
is the same statement pushed into `ℝ≥0∞`, which is the form band item A3 integrates.

## What is *not* here

The integration (`∫⁻_B m ^ 2 ≤ 2 ∑ |T_i ∩ T_j|`), the Cauchy–Schwarz step, the narrow mass
accounting and the cap rescaling are items A3–A5 and are not touched.

`Tube.volume_inter_le_of_angle`. Tube directions are only well defined up to sign, so this — and
not `‖u - v‖` — is the quantity the broad/narrow decomposition must be phrased in. -/

/-- **The bilinear pointwise inequality** (band item A2's contract).

On the broad set, the multiplicity is controlled *bilinearly*: `m(x) ^ 2` is at most twice the
number of transverse ordered pairs of shades through `x`. The cap radius `r` must exceed the
transversality threshold `t` by the net's covering radius `2 * θ` — that is the whole content of
the hypothesis `t + 2 * θ ≤ r`, and it is where `Tube.sphere_sep_net`'s `2θ` cover radius (rather
than `θ`) is paid for.

The mechanism: for `i` with `x ∈ Y_i`, pick the net direction `p` covering `dir T_i`; every `j`
with `x ∈ Y_j` and `dirDist (dir T_i) (dir T_j) < t` then has `dirDist (dir T_j) p ≤ t + 2θ ≤ r`,
so lies in the cap `𝕋_p`. Broadness at `p` bounds those `j` by `m(x)/2`, and
`card_sq_le_two_mul_card_notNear` converts that into the bilinear bound. -/

/-! ## The packing constant `C_P` -/

/-- **The one-sign-branch packing constant.** A `θ`-separated set of points inside a ball of
radius `4 * θ` has at most this many members (`card_le_capBranchConst`): the packing bound
`Tube.card_le_of_separated_parameterSpace` at separation radius `θ / 2` gives the factor
`(θ/2)^{-d}`, the `θ/2`-thickening of the `4θ`-ball sits inside the `5θ`-ball, and
`(2/θ)^d · (5θ)^d = 10^d`. Nothing here depends on `θ`, which is the point. -/

    * ENNReal.ofReal ((10 : ℝ) ^ (finrank ℝ E)) * volume (ball (0 : E) 1)

/-- **The cap packing constant `C_P`** of the narrow case's fullness pigeonhole: a single
direction lies in at most `C_P` of the `4θ`-caps (modulo sign) of a `θ`-separated net of unit
directions (`card_filter_dirDist_le`).

`C_P = 2 · C_cov(d)⁻¹ · 10^d · |B(0,1)|` (open unit ball), where `d = finrank ℝ E` and `C_cov` is
`Metric.coveringNumber_mul_pow_le_volume_cthickening.C`. In `d = 3` that reads
`2 · C_cov(3)⁻¹ · 1000 · |B(0,1)|`.

**The factor `2` is the sign convention, not slack.** `Tube.sphere_sep_net` separates in the plain
norm `‖a - b‖`, so a net may contain both `p` and `-p`, whose `dirDist` is `0`; the caps are
therefore counted on the two sign branches `‖u - p‖ ≤ 4θ` and `‖u + p‖ ≤ 4θ` separately and the
counts added. -/
