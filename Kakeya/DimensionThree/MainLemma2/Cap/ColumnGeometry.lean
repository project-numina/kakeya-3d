# The geometric columns of the Cap Lemma: the A4/A5 seam

Band item A4 (`Cap/NarrowMass.lean`) localises a cap to a *column* through an abstract
pigeonhole: `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.mult_cap_le_max_columns` takes **any** family of pairwise
disjoint measurable sets `A c` covering the shades, with a per-tube incidence bound as the
caller's data. Band item A5 (`Cap/Rescale.lean`) rescales a *geometric* column: its
`Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapColumn` hypothesis asks for a transverse bound on the tube
**midpoints** relative to a base point. Nothing connected the two, and the band plan lists the
connection as nobody's deliverable. This file is that connection.

## What is produced

Fix a unit vector `p` and a transverse frame `e₁, e₂` (`IsTransverseFrame`, which exists
whenever `finrank ℝ E = 3` — `exists_isTransverseFrame`). The *columns* are the fibres of

`columnIndex e₁ e₂ θ x = (⌊⟪e₁, x⟫ / (3θ/4)⌋, ⌊⟪e₂, x⟫ / (3θ/4)⌋)`,

i.e. the half-open squares of side `columnSide θ = 3θ/4` in the two transverse coordinates,
extruded along the `p`-axis. Being fibres of a function they are **automatically** pairwise
disjoint and they cover *everything*; the four facts A4 needs are

* measurability — `measurableSet_columnSet`;
* pairwise disjointness — `pairwiseDisjoint_columnSet`;
* covering of the unit ball by the finite index box — `subset_iUnion_columnSet_of_ball`;
* the per-tube incidence count `K = 9` — `card_filter_columnSub_le`.

and the geometric bridge is `norm_perpAxis_midpoint_sub_columnRef_le`: if the shade of a cap
tube meets a column, its midpoint is transversally within `2θ` of that column's base point.

## The two constants, and the hypothesis that forces each

Write `s = columnSide θ` and `ρ = θ/2 + δ` for the transverse radius of a cap tube's carrier
about its own midpoint (`norm_perpAxis_sub_midpoint_le`: a tilt of `θ` over half a unit core
gives `θ/2`, the thickness gives `δ`).

* **The incidence count is `K = 9 = 3²`**, three values per transverse coordinate times the
  two transverse dimensions of `ℝ³`. Three per coordinate needs `ρ ≤ s`, i.e.
  `θ/2 + δ ≤ 3θ/4`, i.e. **`4δ ≤ θ`** — the hypothesis `hδθ` of `card_filter_columnSub_le`,
  and the only thing that forces the count. At `ρ = 2s` four values occur per coordinate and
  the count degrades to `25`; `floor_count_needs_radius_le_side` is the compiled refutation of
  the three-value statement at that radius, so the hypothesis is not decoration.
* **The transverse bound is `2θ`**, from `ρ + (3/2)s ≤ 2θ`: the midpoint is within `ρ` of any
  carrier point transversally, and two points of one column are within `(3/2)s` of each other
  transversally (`3/2` is the rational surrogate for the diagonal `√2` of the square). At
  `s = 3θ/4` this reads `θ/2 + δ + 9θ/8 ≤ 2θ`, i.e. `8δ ≤ 3θ` — the hypothesis of
  `norm_perpAxis_midpoint_sub_columnRef_le`, strictly weaker than the count's `4δ ≤ θ`.

**The side `s = 3θ/4` is pinned, not chosen.** The count forces `s ≥ ρ` and the bridge forces
`ρ + (3/2)s ≤ 2θ`; at the worst admissible `δ = θ/4` these read `3θ/4 ≤ s ≤ 5θ/6`, and
`columnSide_window` records that window as a compiled inequality. A narrower column breaks the
count; a wider one breaks the `2θ` bound, and at four times the cap radius it breaks it
irreparably (`column_side_four_theta_is_refuted`).

## Units: which `4θ` is which

`θ` here is the **cap radius**, equal to A5's reference-tube thickness, i.e. `4 θ_ang` in the
net-separation units . Nothing in this file revisits the cap radius:
that it is `4 θ_ang` and not the plan's `3 θ_ang` was measured by A2 (the sign branch of
`Tube.sphere_sep_net`) and confirmed independently by A3 and A4, and the hypothesis `hdir`
below is literally cap membership at that radius. What this file does revisit is the **column
side**, a different quantity:

* the side proved here is `3θ/4 = 3 θ_ang` — three quarters of the cap radius;
*  asks for a column "of side `4θ`" with `θ` its own reference thickness,
  i.e. `16 θ_ang`. That is **refuted**: `column_side_four_theta_is_refuted` exhibits two points
  of one such column whose transverse separation exceeds `2 · 2θ + 2ρ`, the most two carrier
  points can be separated when both midpoints lie transversally within `2θ` of one base point;
* the plan's own side `4 θ_ang` (= `θ`, the cap radius) is **not** refuted — no pair
  obstruction arises there — but it exceeds the window `[3θ/4, 5θ/6]` that the base-point route
  of `norm_perpAxis_midpoint_sub_columnRef_le` admits, because that route measures from a point
  *of* the column (forced: A5's clause needs `‖b‖ ≤ 1`, which a column centre need not satisfy)
  rather than from its centre. So `4 θ_ang` is outside this proof's reach, not shown false.

## Why `2θ` and not something else

`2θ` is not free: it is exactly the constant in A5's column clause, with `θ` the *cap radius*
`4 θ_ang` (equal to A5's reference-tube thickness). The conclusion of
`exists_column_localisation` is written in the elementary form
`‖(m - b) - ⟪p, m - b⟫ • p‖ ≤ 2 * θ`, which is literally A5's `hcolumn` hypothesis, so this
file does **not** import A5 and A5's file need not change.

## Relation to A4's constants

`exists_column_localisation` calls `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.mult_cap_le_max_columns` at `K = 9`,
so its fullness threshold is A4's `λ / (2K) = λ / 18` and its multiplicity factor is A4's `2`.
The `72 = 8 · 9`  is the product of A4's narrow factor `8` with the
`9` proved here; the `9` is confirmed, the `72` is not needed, and A4's better factor `2`
stands.

cannot be the geometric centre of the column (which may leave the unit ball). It is instead a
point of the column *inside* the unit ball, chosen once and for all; every column that a shade

/-- **A4 ⇒ A5, in one call.**

Given a family all of whose directions lie within `θ` of the axis `p` (a *cap* of radius `θ`),
all of whose carriers lie in the unit ball, at a scale `4δ ≤ θ`, and with fullness at least
`18 t`, there is a **geometric column** `Y` — a half-open square of side `3θ/4` transverse to
`p`, extruded along the axis — and a base point `b ∈ B̄(0,1)` such that the subfamily `v` of
tubes meeting `Y`, shaded down to `Y`, satisfies

* the three clauses of A5's `Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapColumn` about `b` (cap condition,
  unit-ball containment, and the transverse midpoint bound `2θ`), the last of which is the
  content of this file;
* A4's two conclusions: the fullness survives at `t = λ/18`, and the multiplicity of the whole
  family is at most `2` times the multiplicity of the column subfamily.

The `18 = 2 · 9` is A4's `2K` at the `K = 9` proved in `card_filter_columnSub_le`. The column
clause is stated in elementary form, so A5's producer consumes it with no conversion, and this
file imports nothing of A5. -/

/-! ## 10. Sharpness: the column side is pinned from above too

 writes the column side as `4θ` with `θ` A5's own reference thickness, i.e.
**four times the cap radius**. That reading is **refuted** here, in the same style as A5's
`Kakeya.CapRescale.fullness_loss_is_forced`: at four times the cap radius a single column has
more transverse extent than the whole `2θ` midpoint budget can absorb, so no choice of base
point makes A5's `column` clause true for every tube meeting the column.

's own `θ' := 4θ` is a **different number** — `4 θ_ang`, i.e. exactly the
cap radius, one quarter of the above. That one is **not** refuted: it merely lies outside the
window `[3θ/4, 5θ/6]` that this file's base-point route admits (module docstring, units
section). And nothing here touches the **cap radius** `4 θ_ang` itself, whose `3 θ_ang`
alternative A2, A3 and A4 refuted independently; the cap radius is this file's `θ`.

The column side that works is `columnSide θ = 3θ/4 = 3 θ_ang`, pinned from below by the
incidence count and from above by the midpoint budget. -/
