# The cap rescaling of the Cap Lemma (band item A5)

This file is item **A5** of the Cap Lemma plan (mathematics in
§2(c) "rescale"): the step that takes a *cap column* of `δ`-tubes — tubes whose directions all lie
within a fixed angular radius of a common direction `p`, and which all sit transversally close to
one line parallel to `p` — and produces from it an honest family of `σ`-tubes **inside the unit
ball**, at the coarser scale `σ = δ / (4 θ)`, transporting the three quantities the induction
reads: multiplicity, fullness and `Δ_max`.

Its consumers are A4 (the narrow mass accounting, which produces the cap columns) and A6 (the
induction, which consumes `Kakeya.CapRescale.exists_capRescaledFamily`).

## What was already in the tree, and what had to be new

The *transport* half is already there:
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/Reduction/SpineOuterTubes.lean` defines
`Kakeya.ML2Reduction.outerFamily` and proves, for the spine rescaling,

| quantity | lemma | loss |
|---|---|---|
| `carrier ⊆ B₁` | `outerFamily_carrier_subset_closedBall` | none |
| `μ` | `outerFamily_multiplicity` | **none** (an equality) |
| `λ` | `outerFamily_le_fullness` | `outerLoss R = (4 R)^6` |
| `Δ_max` | `outerFamily_maxDensity_le` | `outerLoss R = (4 R)^6` |

Every one of those four is stated under the single hypothesis
`hsub : ∀ i ∈ s, (𝕋 i).carrier ⊆ T₀.carrier`, the containment of each tube in the ambient
reference tube.  **That hypothesis is unavailable in a cap column, and not by a constant.**  A
`Tube` (`Kakeya/Tube/Basic.lean`; it sits at the root namespace, **not** under `Kakeya.`) has a
core of length exactly `1` (`Tube.dist_eq_one`), so a unit-core `θ`-tube cannot contain a
unit-core `δ`-tube whose centre is displaced *along* its axis; and the tubes of a
cap column, all of which live in `B₁`, are displaced along the axis by up to `2`.  So the
containment cannot be arranged by enlarging `θ` either — it fails for a reason of length, not of
thickness.

What this file does is therefore **replace `hsub`, not weaken a constant**:

1. `Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapDistortion` — the *two* fields of `Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion`
   that `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` actually reads.  Both are position-free.  That the two suffice
   is measured, not argued: `Kakeya.CapRescale.rescale_outer_tube_of_isCapDistortion` re-derives
   the tree's `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` from `Kakeya.CapRescale.capRescale_outer_tube` in one
   step, so the three remaining fields (`one_le_dist`, `exists_subsegment`,
   `image_ambient_subset_closedBall`) are inert in the kernel.  Those three are exactly the ones
   whose proofs need the containment.
2. `Kakeya.CapRescale.isCapDistortion_of_dirDist` — the two fields from the **cap condition
   alone**: `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.dirDist (T.direction) (T₀.direction) ≤ θ`.  The image core is
   then of length `≤ √2 ≤ 2 ≤ C_N(n)`, and the thin-image clause needs no hypothesis at all
   beyond `θ ≤ 1`.
3. `Kakeya.CapRescale.norm_perpTo_sub_x_le_of_column` — *column localisation*: a tube of the cap
   whose **midpoint** is transversally within `b θ` of the axis stays transversally within
   `(b + 3/2) θ` of it along its whole length.  This is 's "a tube of `𝕋_p`
   stays within transverse distance `3θ/2 + δ_k` of the line through its centre parallel to `p`",
   proved.  It is the only *positional* hypothesis the rescaling needs, and it is exactly what a
   column partition supplies.
4. `Kakeya.CapRescale.normalization_image_subset_closedBall_of_column` — the `hball` hypothesis of
   `Tube.rescale_outer_tube`, from (3) plus the standing `B₁` hypothesis.  The spine route gets
   this from the containment
   (`Kakeya.ML2Reduction.normalization_image_subset_closedBall_of_subset`); here it is
   `A + b + 3/2 ≤ R`, which at `A = 3`, `b = 2` reads `13/2 ≤ R` and is implied by
   `C_N(3) = 64 ≤ R`.

## The single map, and why there is no translation bookkeeping

 proposes a **per-tube** ambient tube `T₀(i)` (same midpoint as `T_i`,
direction `p`), obtained from `Tube.tube_carrier_subset_of_close`, and then repairs the resulting
mismatch of maps by a translation `v_i` and a `Tube.vadd`.  That route does work — the linear
parts agree, so the maps differ by a constant — but it is **unnecessary here and strictly worse**:
the transport of multiplicity, fullness and `Δ_max` requires *one* affine map for the whole
family, and re-anchoring per tube then costs a translation bookkeeping *plus* a fresh proof that
the translated outer tube still lies in `B₁` (`Tube.centredExtension_subset_closedBall` no longer
applies on the nose).  Using a *single* reference tube `Kakeya.CapRescale.capRefTube θ b hp`
at the column's base point, none of that arises: `Kakeya.CapRescale.capOuterTube_spec` already
delivers `(outerTube …).carrier ⊆ closedBall 0 1`.  So `Tube.tube_carrier_subset_of_close` and
`Tube.vadd` are **not used in this file**, and the reason is recorded here rather than left
implicit.

## The scale, and the constants

* `Kakeya.CapRescale.capScale θ δ = δ / (4 θ)` — the plan's `σ = δ_k/(4 θ')`.  At cap radius
  `θ = θ' = 4 θ_ang` this is `δ/(16 θ_ang)` (`Kakeya.CapRescale.capScale_of_angular`), i.e. the
  plan's `δ_k^{1-c}/16` at `θ_ang = δ_k^c`.  The extra hypothesis `δ/θ ≤ 4 σ` of the outer-tube
  lemma holds with **equality** at this scale (`Kakeya.CapRescale.capScale_ratio`), so the cap
  scale is the coarsest the lemma allows and nothing is thrown away.
* `Kakeya.CapRescale.capLoss = (4 R)^6` at `R = C_N(3) = 64` — the one absolute constant, the
  volume loss of replacing a rescaled body by an honest tube.
* The cap radius is `4 θ_ang`, **not** 's `3 θ_ang`; see  (the net of `Tube.sphere_sep_net` covers only within `2 θ_ang`) and  (at
  `3 θ_ang` the side condition `t + 2 θ ≤ r` reads `4 θ ≤ 3 θ`, false).  Here that correction is
  what makes the *reference thickness* equal the *cap radius*, so the `dir` clause of
  `Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapColumn` is literally membership in
  `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.capFamily s 𝕋 p (4 θ_ang)`.
* `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.capPackingConst` (`C_P`) does **not** appear in this file.  It is the
  cap-*overlap* count and belongs to A4's fullness pigeonhole; it enters the composition only
  through the value of `l` that A4 hands to A6, never through the rescaling.  (Same finding as
   for the broad half.)

## Which hypothesis forces which loss

* **Multiplicity: no loss, and none is forced.**  `ShadedBody.multiplicity` reads only the shades
  and their union; the outer replacement changes neither and the affine map multiplies numerator
  and denominator by one Jacobian.  `Kakeya.CapRescale.capOuterFamily_multiplicity` accordingly
  does **not** take `1 ≤ R` and does not mention `capLoss` — a typed certificate that no factor is
  being carried as decoration.
* **Fullness: `capLoss` is forced by the volume clause alone.**  Fullness is `∑|Y_i| / ∑|T_i|`,
  antitone in the denominator, which the replacement enlarges;
  `Kakeya.CapRescale.fullness_loss_is_forced` is the `ℝ≥0∞` refutation of the factor-free
  statement.  The clause's own source is that `Kakeya.ML2Reduction.outerTube` has unit core while
  the rescaled core may be as short as `1/(4R)`
  (`Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image`).
* **`Δ_max`: `capLoss` is forced by the volume clause; the containment clause is free.**  The
  containment shrinks the set of bodies inside a test body, which helps;
  `Kakeya.CapRescale.maxDensity_loss_is_forced` refutes the factor-free statement.

## Non-vacuity

`Kakeya.CapRescale.isCapColumn_nonvacuous` exhibits a concrete inhabitant of
`Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapColumn` (the reference tube itself, shaded by `∅`), so the two
quantitative clauses are simultaneously satisfiable; and
`Kakeya.CapRescale.isCapColumn_capRefTube` is the producer a column partition calls.

/-! ## 2. The two distortion facts that the outer-tube lemma actually reads -/

/-- **The distortion data `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` consumes.**

`Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion` (`Kakeya/Tube/Rescale.lean`) has five fields, and is available
only under the containment `T.carrier ⊆ T₀.carrier` (`Tube.normalization_distortion`).  Of those
five, `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` reads exactly **two**: the upper bound on the image core length
and the thin-image clause.  Both are *position-free*, so both survive the failure of the
containment in a cap column, and that is what makes the cap rescaling possible at all.

That the two fields suffice is not an argument but a compiled fact:
`Kakeya.CapRescale.rescale_outer_tube_of_isCapDistortion` re-derives `Tube.rescale_outer_tube`
from `Kakeya.CapRescale.capRescale_outer_tube` and
`Kakeya.CapRescale.isCapDistortion_of_isNormalizationDistortion` in one step. -/

/-- **The image core of a nearly axial tube is short.**

The only input is that the direction of `T` is within `θ` of the axis of `T₀` in the sign-blind
angular distance `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.dirDist` — no containment, no position hypothesis.  The
bound is `√2 ≤ 2`, stated as `2`; the mechanism is
`Tube.norm_sq_normalization_sub`: the axial component is untouched (`≤ 1`) and the transverse one
is multiplied by `θ⁻¹`, but is itself `≤ θ`. -/

`Tube.rescale_outer_tube` needs `Φ_{T₀}(T) ⊆ B̄(T₀.x, R)`, which the spine route obtains from the
containment `T ⊆ T₀` (`Kakeya.ML2Reduction.normalization_image_subset_closedBall_of_subset`).  In

/-- **`Tube.rescale_outer_tube` under the two-field distortion package.**

Identical conclusion, strictly weaker hypothesis: `Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion` is replaced by
`Kakeya.CapRescale.IsCapDistortion`.  The proof is the tree's, with the three unused fields of the
package never mentioned; the volume clause needs no distortion data at all
(`Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image` takes only the rescaling situation). -/

/-! ## 6. The cap family and its four transports -/

/-- **The cap–column situation.**

The hypothesis package the cap rescaling runs on.  It replaces the spine route's single
containment `∀ i ∈ s, (𝕋 i).carrier ⊆ T₀.carrier`, which is **unavailable** in a cap column: a
`Tube` (`Kakeya/Tube/Basic.lean`; it sits at the root namespace, **not** under `Kakeya.`) has a
core of length exactly `1` (`Tube.dist_eq_one`), so a unit-core `θ`-tube cannot contain a
unit-core `δ`-tube whose centre is displaced *along* the axis, and the tubes of
a cap column are displaced along the axis by up to `2`.  What replaces it is two position-free
facts plus one genuinely positional one:

* `dir` — the cap condition, i.e. membership in `Kakeya.CapBroadNarrow.capFamily s 𝕋 p (4 θ_ang)`
  at reference thickness `θ = 4 θ_ang`;
* `column` — the column condition: the *midpoint* is within transverse distance `2 θ` of the axis;
* `ball`, `base` — the standing `B₁` hypothesis of the Cap Lemma, and that the reference tube is
  anchored in `B₁`.

/-- **(c) The fullness drops by at most `(4 R)^6`.**

The loss is forced by, and only by, `capOuterShadedTube_volume_le`: `ShadedBody.fullness` is
`∑|Y_i| / ∑|T_i|`, the shades are unchanged, and the denominator grows by exactly the factor the
volume clause allows.  Its ultimate source is that `Kakeya.ML2Reduction.outerTube` has a core of
length `1` while the rescaled core may be as short as `1/(4 R)`, i.e.
`Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image`. -/

Two hypotheses force this and both are used: the containment `spineImage_le_capOuterShadedTube`
(which makes the set of bodies inside a test body *shrink*, and is therefore free of charge) and
the volume clause (which supplies the factor).  See
