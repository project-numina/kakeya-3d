# The goal-reduction layer of Main Lemma 2, very not sticky case

The leaves of the case analysis of Main Lemma 2 state their conclusions in three different
currencies: the multiplicity form `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult`, the
volume form `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion`, and the density form
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalDensity`. This file converts them into one
another:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_goalUnion` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion_of_goalMult` are the two halves of blueprint
  `lem:ml2goalUTequiv`. Neither currency carries a comparison constant, so the equivalence is
  exact up to the loss `η` in the gain, which comes from `λ(T, Y) ≥ δ^η` alone.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion_of_goalDensity` is blueprint `lem:ml2goalfromdens`. It
  consumes the two scale-`r` estimates of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData`, packaged as
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData`, and is otherwise exact bookkeeping.

Both the density currency and the cross-section interface carry a *variable radius* `r ≥ a`,
not the fixed scale `a`: the thick case produces its density estimate at `r = a` exactly,
while the transverse case produces it at `r = θ b ≥ δ^{-τ'} a`, and the requirement at radius
`a` carries the factor `(δ/a)^{2β}` that the transverse branch cannot make small. The
conversion is exact at every radius, since the two factors `r^{2β}` cancel.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData` is the *cross-section interface* of this layer: its two
estimates are blueprint `lowerBoundTTScaleAAndABall` (owned by Section 5, via
`ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes`) and blueprint `volumeOfTTa` (owned by
Section 3, via `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound`). Its existence,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`, is proved here from the named interface statements
of `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.AScaleInterface`, which carry what those two sections owe;
see the docstring of that declaration.

/-! ### Monotonicity in the gain -/

/-- The volume form of the goal is antitone in the gain.
For `0 < δ ≤ 1` the map `s ↦ δ^s` is antitone, so a branch that supplies a larger gain
supplies the smaller one as well. This is the fact used whenever two branches of the case
split with different gains are combined. -/

/-! ### The volume and multiplicity currencies agree -/

/-- **Blueprint `lem:ml2goalUTequiv`(i)**.
The volume form with gain `ν` implies the multiplicity form with gain `ν`.

By `ShadedBody.multiplicity_mul_union`, `μ(T,Y) |U(T,Y)| = ∑_T |Y(T)|`, which equals
`λ(T,Y) ∑_T |T|` by `ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul` and is at most
`∑_T |T|` because `λ(T,Y) ≤ 1` (`ShadedBody.fullness_le_one`). The volume form bounds that by
`δ^ν |U(T,Y)| |𝕋|^β`. Only `λ(T,Y) ≤ 1` is used, so no hypothesis on the configuration is
needed. -/

/-! ### The scale-`a` interface -/

/-- **The two scale-`r` estimates**, as a predicate on the
configuration, the comparison constant `C`, the radius `r` and the gain `ν`.

`AScaleData cfg C r ν` asserts that there is a set `Ur` — the shaded union
`U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})` of the family of `r`-tubes of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` — such that

* (i) for every `r`-ball meeting `U(T, Y)`,
  `δ^{ν/9} |U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})| |U(T,Y) ∩ B_r| ≤ C |U(T,Y)| |B_r|`;
  this is blueprint `lowerBoundTTScaleAAndABall`, and it comes from
  `ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes` applied to `(T, Y)` at the scale
  `ρ = r`, after re-centring the ball at a shaded point;
* (ii) `δ^{ν/9} r^{2β} ∑_T |T| ≤ C |U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})| δ^{2β} |𝕋|^β`;
  this is blueprint `volumeOfTTa`, and it comes from
  `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound` applied to `(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})` together with the
  two-scale bound `Δ_max(𝕋_r) ≤ δ^{-η}(r/δ)²/|𝕋[T_r]|`.

The radius is a parameter: the intended range is `cfg.a ≤ r`, at which the coarsening to
`r`-tubes is available, and the two estimates are always used at the radius at which the
consumer's density estimate `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalDensity` was produced. Taking
`r = cfg.a` recovers the scale-`a` estimates of the blueprint verbatim, which is the form the
thick case uses.

Both are stated for the shading `Y` recorded by `cfg`, not for a further refinement of it.
This is the standing abuse of notation of the blueprint: the `≈ 1` refinement produced by
`ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes` at the scale `a` is taken *while*
Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` is being assembled (blueprint `lem:ml2setupexists` lists
`shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes` among its inputs), so the pair recorded by `cfg` is
already the refined one.

Both estimates are written without division and without negative exponents, so that they are
statements about `[0, ∞]`-valued quantities requiring no finiteness side conditions. The
constant `C` is quantified *before* the ball in (i), which is what allows it to appear in the
hypothesis `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalDensity` about a ball that is only chosen later. -/

/-- Both estimates of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData` are monotone in the comparison
constant, the constant occurring only on the right of each. This is what lets the proof of
blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData` produce its two clauses with the two different constants
`C_{lem:ml2aScaleBall}` and `C_{lem:ml2aScaleVolume}` and then take their maximum. -/

/-- **Estimate (i) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData` from the section-5 interface**
(blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleBall`, read at the scale `r`).

The hypothesis `hvol` is the ninth conclusion `boundVolumeAcrossTwoScales` of
`Kakeya.ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes` applied at `ρ = r`: it is asserted
for *every* admissible centre with the one constant `Cb`, which is the uniformity that
`Kakeya.aScaleBall` converts into an estimate at an arbitrary ball, by re-centring at a shaded
point. The family `G` is the fully shaded factor family that
interface produces, and `hinner`, `hbody` say that its inner side is the pair `(𝕋, Y)` recorded
by `cfg` — the standing abuse of notation of the blueprint, under which the `≈ 1` refinement is
absorbed into Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` while that configuration is assembled.

Estimate (ii), `hcoarse`, is passed through: it is blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleVolume`, i.e.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aScaleVolume`, read at the coarse union `U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})` of the same
family `G`, and this lemma does no work on it.

What is left between this bridge and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData` is exactly the
production of `G` and of `hcoarse`; see the docstring of that declaration. -/

/-- **The absorption clause of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData`(iii)**, isolated from the
geometry.

A comparison constant bounded by the accumulated constant `C_⋆` that the threshold bundle
absorbs at the exponent `cfg.η` satisfies `C ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-η}`, provided `δ` lies below the
threshold at the gain `ν`. This is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds.aScale_absorb`
composed with the monotonicity of squaring, and it is the whole of what the hypothesis
`hthr` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData` is for.

The hypothesis `hC` is the link that the threshold bundle cannot state on its own: neither
`Kakeya.aScaleBallConstant` nor `Kakeya.aScaleVolumeConstant` is nameable where
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds` is declared, and the second of them depends on the
uniformity constants `C₀, D₀` of the configuration, which the bundle does not see. See the

/-- **Cross-section estimate interface**.

Under Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, for a radius `r ≥ a` and a gain `ν ≥ 90 η`, the two
scale-`r` estimates of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData` hold with some finite comparison
constant `C ≥ 1`, and moreover `δ` lies below the fixed-scale threshold at which `C²` and a
prescribed finite factor `M` are absorbed by the power `δ^{-e}`, for any `e > 0`.

**The absorption, and why it is split.** It is the second obligation absorbed here, and it is
the one that makes the two producers of the density currency usable. Both of them have to
deliver `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalDensity` at the *prescribed* constant `C²` — prescribed
because `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_goalDensity` demands exactly that value — while each
of them also carries a comparison constant `M` of its own, produced existentially by a
section-5 or section-6 interface (`Cbf` in the transverse case, `Θ`, `C₁` in the thick case).
Paying for both out of a surplus power of `δ` splits into two obligations of quite different
character, and they belong on different sides of the statement.

The producer's constant `M` is named by the consumer, hence *after* `δ` is fixed, so
"`δ` is small in terms of `M`" cannot be a conclusion here: for `M` large and `δ` already
fixed no threshold on `δ` can be met. Asserting `C² * M ≤ δ^{-e}`
for arbitrary finite `M` and arbitrary `e > 0` would therefore be false.
The required condition is the hypothesis `hM'`,
`M ≤ δ^{-(e - η)}`: exactly the "`δ` small in terms of the
constant being absorbed" threshold stated where it can be discharged, namely at the call site, by the branch that knows what `M` is.
The transverse case discharges it from the sub-polynomial bound on `Cbf` carried by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill` together with the budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.transverse`; the thick case invokes the statement at `M = 1`
and `e = cfg.η`, where it reads `1 ≤ δ^0`.

What remains is the conjunct `C ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-cfg.η}`, a genuine
sub-polynomiality requirement on the constant *this* statement produces. Since `C` is chosen
here, this is the only place such a requirement can be stated; quantified over arbitrary `C`
in a hypothesis bundle such as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` it would be refutable and
would make that bundle — and with it every leaf consuming it — vacuous. Its exponent is the
*fixed* `cfg.η`, rendering blueprint `def:ml2aScaleDataExponent`, and **not** the consumer's
`e/2`: at the consumer's exponent the conjunct would inherit the very quantifier-order defect
described for `M`, since `e` too is named after `δ`, and letting `e ↓ 0` would force
`C ≤ 1`. What it asks is the `δ`-independence of `C`, the quantitative requirement that blueprint
`def:ml2goalfromdensConstant` records, *together with* a threshold on `δ` — blueprint
`def:ml2aScaleDataThreshold`, the eighth clause of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` — without
which it is false at `δ` near `1`. That threshold is the hypothesis `hthr`,
`cfg.δ ≤ thr.aScale ν`, and it is *not* among the hypotheses absorbed into this stub: it is
the one clause of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` this statement uses, and it is stated at the
gain `ν` at which the statement is invoked, since blueprint `def:ml2aScaleDataThreshold`
makes the threshold a function of `ν` (and of `β, ζ, η, C₀, D₀`), all fixed before `δ`.
Consumers receive it threaded from blueprint `lem:ml2casesplit`, never arrange it: the
transverse case supplies it from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.aScaleData_threshold` at the transverse gain, the thick case
from the corresponding binder of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge_of_goalDensity` at the thick gain.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds` now carries the defining property of blueprint
`def:ml2aScaleDataThreshold` for this field: below `thr.aScale ν` the accumulated constant
`thr.aScaleConst ν cfg.η` of the layer satisfies `C_⋆ ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-η}`. Spending `hthr` on it is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.sq_le_rpow_neg_of_le_aScaleConst`, and that is the whole of the
absorption once a constant bounded by `C_⋆` is in hand.

One half of the absorption is not expressible where the bundle is declared: that the constants
this layer actually produces — `Kakeya.aScaleBallConstant`, read at the fixed constant of
`ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes`, and
`Kakeya.aScaleVolumeConstant cfg.C₀ cfg.D₀` — are absorbed too. Asserting it on the bundle
would need `aScale` to be a function of `C₀` and `D₀` as well as of `ν`, as blueprint
`def:ml2aScaleDataThreshold` writes it, since quantified over those constants it is false. It
is therefore carried by the configuration, as the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aScaleData_absorb`, which absorbs
`Kakeya.aScaleDataConstant cfg.C₀ cfg.D₀`, the maximum of the two. The `δ → 1` refutation of
the conjunct is barred by that field, and arranging it is part of realising the
configuration.

Clause (iv) of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData`, `C ^ 2 * M ≤ δ^{-e}`, is *not* a conjunct of the
conclusion. It asserts nothing beyond the previous conjunct and the consumer's own threshold
on `M` — it is their product, by one `mul_le_mul'` and one `ENNReal.rpow_add`, the exponents
`cfg.η` and `e - cfg.η` summing to `e` — and carrying it here dragged five binders `e`, `he`,
`M`, `hM`, `hM'` into a signature that is otherwise one existential; `he` and `hM` were dead
even for that arithmetic. The recombination is `ENNReal.sq_mul_le_rpow_neg`, a standalone
`ℝ≥0∞` lemma with no Kakeya content, which each consumer applies to the conjunct
`C ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-η}` produced here and to its own bound on `M`.

**What this declaration assumes.** Its content is owned by other sections of the development,
not by the goal-reduction layer of Section 9:

* estimate (i) is blueprint `lowerBoundTTScaleAAndABall`, i.e. the conclusion
  `boundVolumeAcrossTwoScales` of `ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes`
  (Section 5), applied at `ρ = r` and re-centred at a shaded point;
* estimate (ii) is blueprint `volumeOfTTa`, i.e. `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound`
  (blueprint `genKKT`, Section 3) applied to the `r`-tube family,
  together with the two-scale multiplicity bound
  `Δ_max(𝕋_r) ≤ δ^{-η}(r/δ)²/|𝕋[T_r]|` of blueprint `lem:ml2DeltamaxScaleA`, which requires the corresponding two-scale counting estimate.

Neither is assumed here in that raw form. What the proof below consumes are the two named
statements of `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.AScaleInterface`, each of which is the coarse-shading statement and a docstring saying which blueprint result owns it and why the existing
declaration cannot be applied as it stands. One obligation of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData`
that the Lean signature has no binder for is absorbed into those statements and recorded in
their docstrings: the scale thresholds `δ < δ_0(ν/90, β)` and `η ≤ η_{genKKT}(ν/90, β)`
demanded by blueprint `genKKT`, for which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` carries no field. The
blueprint's other extra hypothesis, the upper bound `r ≤ 1`, is *not* absorbed: it is the
binder `hr1` of this signature, and it may not be dropped, since without it the conjunction of
(i) and (ii) is refutable — see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`. The
uniformity in the centre `x` of the constant hidden in the `⪆` of `boundVolumeAcrossTwoScales`
— one constant, valid for all admissible centres — is instead written out
explicitly, as the quantifier order of the ball conjunct of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_coarseShadedFamilyAtGrid` and of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.coarseBallEstimate_of_gridScale`: without it the constant would depend on
the ball chosen by the density hypothesis and blueprint `lem:ml2goalfromdens` would be
circular.

Section 5's two-sided per-tube shading hypotheses are likewise not absorbed. They are not a
consequence of `cfg.fullness_ge`, which is a ratio of sums, so they are carried as the
configuration fields `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lam`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.Cd`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.shading_lb` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.shading_ub`, with
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lam_ge` bridging the resulting outer-fullness conclusion back to the
`δ^{cfg.η}` this layer consumes.

Everything downstream of this declaration — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion_of_goalDensity`
and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_goalDensity` — is proved from `AScaleData` as an
explicit hypothesis and is independent of how it is obtained.

**How the proof runs.** Three of the four steps of the blueprint's proof are declarations of
their own:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aScaleData_of_ballEstimate` turns the output of
  `ShadedBody.shadingMultiplicityEstimateForRhoTubes` at `ρ = r` into `AScaleData` at the
  constant `Kakeya.aScaleBallConstant`, passing estimate (ii) through;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aScaleVolume` is estimate (ii),
  proved outright from `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.coarseVolumeLower` and the exponent budget
  `Kakeya.aScaleExponentBudget`, at inputs a parent family `𝕋_r` must supply;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.sq_le_rpow_neg_of_le_aScaleConst` is the conjunct `C ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-η}`,
  and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.AScaleData.mono` is the monotonicity that lets the two constants
  be replaced by their maximum.

What the two families cost is what the interface file carries, and it is a single call.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleInputs` produces one coarse shaded factor family carrying
both estimate (i) at the nominal radius and the five quantities of estimate (ii); its own two
residues are `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_coarseShadedFamilyAtGrid`, owned by Section 5, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.coarseKatzTaoBound`, owned by Section 3. Both are stated at a *grid*
scale of the hierarchy `cfg.uniform` and at the configuration's own overlap constant `cfg.C₀`,
and both are upstream of this layer, which is why they are assumed whole rather than derived.

**The general radius is not an obstruction, and the earlier claim that it was is withdrawn.**
That claim — that a `Tube.UniformTubeSet` parent family is unavailable at a radius `r`
which the hypothesis `cfg.a ≤ r` does not make a grid scale, "the constraint the third remark
of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData` calls genuine and not a formality" — is false. The grid of GWZ
Definition 2.1 has length `M = ⌈log log 1/δ⌉`, so its spacing `δ^{-1/M}` is `δ^{-o(1)}`, and
rounding `r` *up* to the nearest grid scale `ρ` therefore satisfies the two-scale multiplicity
bound and the tube-volume comparison simultaneously at a cost that is nothing on the polynomial
scale. The two were believed to pull against each other, one wanting a parent radius `≤ r` and
the other `≥ r`; read at the same rounded `ρ` the comparison is monotone in the parent radius
and costs nothing (`Kakeya.tubeVolumeRatio_of_le`), while only the multiplicity bound pays, and
it pays `(ρ/r)² ≤ δ^{-2η}` out of the gain. The rounding is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_gridIndex`, the sub-polynomiality of one step is the configuration
field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.gridFine`, and the accounting is the module docstring of
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.AScaleRounding`. GWZ perform the same rounding by hand at
p. 41, at the strictly greater cost `δ^{3η}`.

The two further assumptions this proof used to make are gone. The normalisation `β ≤ 1` is
the field `cfg.hβ1` of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`. The constant-domination link is no longer
needed at all: the two statements above produce their estimates at
`Kakeya.aScaleBallConstant` read at the fixed section-5 constant and at
`Kakeya.aScaleVolumeConstant cfg.C₀ cfg.D₀`, and `Kakeya.aScaleDataConstant cfg.C₀ cfg.D₀` is
by definition their maximum, so the domination is `le_max_left` and `le_max_right`. What used
to be assumed about it is the field `cfg.aScaleData_absorb`, the eighth clause of
Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`, which is stated at the configuration's own uniformity constants
because `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds` cannot see them; see the docstring of that
field. The constant produced here is the maximum of that constant with the one the threshold
bundle absorbs, so both thresholds are spent and the conjunct `C ^ 2 ≤ δ^{-η}` follows from
the two absorptions together. -/

/-- **Cross-section interface**, at every radius `a ≤ r ≤ 1`.

This is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData_of_le_one` under its own name, kept as the
declaration the two branches call so that a future change to the producing layer touches one
signature. Both hypotheses on the radius are those of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData`, and the
upper one is not decoration:

* all tubes of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` lie in the unit ball
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.contained`), so `|U(𝕋, Y)|` and `|U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})|` are bounded, while
  the left-hand side of estimate (ii) carries `r^{2β}`, which is not. Letting `r → ∞` with
  everything else fixed refutes the conjunction of (i) and (ii): (i) caps `|U(𝕋_r, Y_{𝕋_r})|`
  from above, by `C δ^{-ν/9} |U(𝕋,Y)| / Δ`, uniformly in `r ≥ 1`, and (ii) forces it to grow
  like `r^{2β}`. * The hypothesis cannot be absorbed into the producers either; it has to appear in this
  signature.

Both call sites discharge it. The thick branch,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge_of_goalDensity` in `ThickCase`, invokes the interface at
`r = cfg.a`, and `cfg.a ≤ cfg.b ≤ cfg.δ ^ cfg.exscal ≤ 1` by `cfg.hdims`, `cfg.hδ1` and
`cfg.hexscal` — this is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.cfg_a_le_one`. The transverse branch,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge_explicit` in `TransverseCase`, invokes it at the
radius produced by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill`, which now asserts `r ≤ 1`
alongside `θ b ≤ r`; that bound is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFillRadius_le_one`, and it is where the fixed-scale threshold
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverse_fill` is spent a second time.

Everything else this declaration used to assume is now proved. In particular the objection that
the parent family `𝕋_r` at a general radius is unavailable because `r` is not a grid scale is
withdrawn: see the module docstring of
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.AScaleInterface`. -/

/-! ### From the density estimate to the volume goal -/


/-- **Blueprint `lem:ml2goalfromdens`.**
Given the two scale-`r` estimates with comparison constant `C` (blueprint
`lem:ml2aScaleData`, here the hypothesis `hdata`) and the density form of the goal with
constant `C^2` and gain `ν` *at the same radius* `r ≥ a`, the volume form of the goal holds
with gain `ν`. The radius is otherwise unconstrained: it enters only through the two factors
`r^{2β}` that cancel, and through the positivity of `|B_r|`, which `cfg.a ≤ r` supplies.

The computation is exact bookkeeping. Writing `V = |U(T,Y)|`, `W = |U(𝕋_a, Y_{𝕋_a})|`,
`D = |U(T,Y) ∩ B_a|`, `S = ∑_T |T|` and `N = |𝕋|`, multiplying estimate (ii) by the density
hypothesis cancels `a^{2β}` and `δ^{2β}` and leaves
`C² |B_a| δ^{ν/9} S ≤ C N^β δ^{2ν} (W D)`; feeding in estimate (i), which applies because the
density hypothesis forces `D > 0`, and cancelling `C²` and `|B_a|` leaves
`δ^{2ν/9} S ≤ δ^{2ν} V N^β`, that is the volume form with gain `16ν/9`. Since `0 < δ ≤ 1` and
`16ν/9 ≥ ν`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion_of_exponent_le` gives it with gain `ν`.

The three powers of `C` cancel exactly, which is the point of demanding `C^2` in the density
hypothesis, and so do the two factors `(r/δ)^{2β}` and `(δ/r)^{2β}` implicit in the two
estimates. -/
