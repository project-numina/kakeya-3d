# The non-slab case of Main Lemma 2

In this file we assemble the non-slab case of the thin case of Main Lemma 2: the case `b ≤
δ^{exscal} r₁ = δ^{2·exscal}` of the very-not-sticky
configuration, where `b` is the middle affine thickness of the factoring bodies.

The case splits according to the size of the factoring multiplicity `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` at a
ball `B ∈ 𝔅` maximising it.

* If `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ δ^{-η}`, the splitting `Kakeya.NonSlab.multSplit` and the
  Katz–Tao bound `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabKKT` combine directly and give the goal with
  gain `exscal · β`: this is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_le`.
* If `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≥ δ^{-η}`, the angle-selection lemma
  `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` may be run on `𝕎'_B` after presenting it as a
  family of `a' × b' × 1` planks (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`,
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard`), producing a typical angle `θ`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`). Splitting on `θ` against
  `δ^{-τ'} a / b` puts us in the transverse case
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`) or in the tangential case
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`): this is
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge`.

Every branch lemma below is stated relative to `cfg`: the per-ball data of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup` is the bundle `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData cfg` and the thin-case data of
Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig cfg bd`, both from
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.ThinConfig`. The families `𝕎'_B` and shadings `Y_{𝕎'_B}`
are read off `tc.thinBall hB` at the distinguished ball, and never taken as free arguments:
with free arguments the multiplicity hypothesis `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ δ^{-η}` could be
satisfied vacuously by the empty family, and the branch lemmas would be at least as strong as
the theorem they are supposed to prove.

The auxiliary lemmas `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard` are genuinely general statements about a family of bodies,
respectively planks, and are stated for free data as before.

/-! ### The small-multiplicity branch -/

/-- **Main Lemma 2, non-slab case with small factoring multiplicity**.

In the configuration `cfg`, with the per-ball data `bd` of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` and
the thin-case data `tc` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over it, together with the
thin-case refinement `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` and the non-slab hypothesis `b ≤ δ^{2·exscal}`, let
`B ∈ 𝔅` maximise the factoring multiplicity over the cover and suppose
`μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ δ^{-η}` — equivalently, that `μ(𝕎'_{B'}, Y_{𝕎'_{B'}}) ≤ δ^{-η}` for
every `B' ∈ 𝔅`. Then the goal holds with the exponent `ν = exscal · β`.

The family `𝕎'_B` and its shading `Y_{𝕎'_B}` are `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'` and
`(tc.thinBall hB).W`: they must be tied to `cfg`, since for a free family the hypothesis
`hmult` is satisfied vacuously by `bodies' = ∅` (the multiplicity of the empty family is `0`)
and the lemma would then prove the goal unconditionally.

Both `Kakeya.NonSlab.multSplit` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabKKT` are stated at the
dilated scale `ρ₂*`, so they combine directly:
`μ(𝕋, Y) ⪅ δ^{-η} δ^{-(ϱ+η)} (ρ₂^{2+ζ}|𝕋|)^β ≤ δ^{-2η-ϱ} δ^{exscal(2+ζ)β}|𝕋|^β`, using
`ρ₂ ≤ δ^{exscal}` from `rho2_range`. The second `η` is the cost of raising the fibre count to
the `β`-th power, which happens once inside `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabKKT` and which the
bound it produces already carries. The exact inequality needed is therefore
`2η + ϱ < exscal(1+ζ)β`, which is `params.smallMultiplicity`, and it leaves the required gain
`exscal·β` with a positive margin for the remaining fixed constants. The field
`scale.rho2Star_le_one` ensures `ρ₂* ≤ 1`.

The budget is stated with `2η` and not with the `η + ϱ < exscal(1+ζ)β` of earlier versions:
the surplus `exscal(1+ζ)β - (η+ϱ)` of the weaker form is positive but is not known to exceed
`η`, and `η` is fixed before `δ`, so it cannot be shrunk afterwards to absorb the second `η`.
The strengthening is free, since every field of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` bounds `η`
from above only and `η` is chosen last (blueprint `lem:ml2smallmult`, closing paragraph).

The maximality of `B` in the statement above is the hypothesis `hBmax`, and `hβ1 : β ≤ 1` is
the Katz–Tao hypothesis of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabKKT`; both are consumed through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound` and supplied by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_b_le`. -/

/-! ### The large-multiplicity branch: a typical angle of intersection -/

/-- **The data produced by the plank presentation**.

The ten clauses of blueprint `lem:ml2plankpresentation` are bundled here rather than listed as
a conjunctive existential, in the shape `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData` already uses
one screen further down: they are produced together by a single assembly, and the consumer
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` destructures all of them.

The fields fall into four groups.

* *The dimensions* `a' ≤ b' ≤ 1` and the comparisons `hratio`, `hlower`/`hupper`,
  `hblower`/`hbupper`, `hδa'` of the blueprint display `plankDimensionsComparable`. The
  dimensions are only *comparable* to `a/r₁` and `b/r₁`, with the constant `C₀` of (C4),
  since (C4) gives the affine thicknesses of `W` only up to `C₀` and the exact `a' × b' × 1`
  box enclosing `L_B(W)` inherits that slack; the *ratio* `a'/b'` is nevertheless exactly
  `a/b`, which is what the transverse and tangential cases consume.

* *The plank family* `P` with its shading `YP`, together with `hshade` and the localization
  `hwin`. The planks lie in `B̄(0, plankBallRadius)` and not in the unit ball: `L_B(W)` does
  lie in `B̄(0,1)` by `hin`, but the plank is a superset of it. The clause is stated as
  `Plank.IsWindowedFamily` rather than as a bare containment because
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankBallRadius` derives from `Plank.windowRadius`: it is in this form that
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` consumes it, and stating it at any larger radius would leave
  that hypothesis undischarged.

* *The retained subfamily* `sel`, with `hsel` and `hselRefine`. The enclosing planks are
  **not** pairwise essentially distinct on all of `bodies'`, for any choice of them; see
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant`. What survives is the subfamily, retained at
  the cost of the refinement factor `(plankSelectionConstant C₀)⁻¹`. The clause that asserted
  the essential distinctness of `sel`'s planks, `hselEd`, was deleted by R26, so `sel` is
  carried for its mass retention alone.

* *The transported invariants* `hmult`, `hdens` and the rescaling bridge `hbridge`. Note that
  `hdens` is an inequality where `hmult` is an equality: `μ` sees only the shadings, which the
  enclosure leaves alone, whereas `Δ_max` sees the carriers, which the enclosure enlarges.

**The bridge is stated for a general sub-index-set `t ⊆ bodies'.** A `c`-refinement is allowed
to drop indices (`ShadedBody.IsRefinement`), the blueprint's `def:refinement` says so
explicitly, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isCRefinement_of_plankRescale` — the lemma that
discharges this field — is stated at that generality. Restricting to `t = bodies'` would make
the field unusable for a refinement obtained by selection. Two radii appear because the
estimate to be transported — item `itemballfull` of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` — compares
the volume of a ball of one radius with the shaded mass in a concentric ball of a larger one;
no comparison constant is lost, `L_B` being an exact homothety of ratio `r₁⁻¹` followed by a
translation. The hypothesis is stated for closed balls and the conclusion for open ones, which
is what the consumer needs and costs nothing, spheres being Lebesgue null in `ℝ³`.

**The bridge also hands back the bijection.** The pulled-back shading is `L_B⁻¹(Y_{𝒫'})`
index for index, and the middle clause of `hbridge` says so, in the coordinate-free form
`∃ g : ℝ³ ≃ ℝ³, (Wsh' i).shade = g '' (Y_{𝒫'} i).shade`; the centre of the ball is not a
parameter of this structure, so the map itself cannot be named here. Without that clause the
`c`-refinement alone gives only `(Wsh' i).shade ⊆ (Wsh i).shade`, which is not enough to move
a statement about the *fibres* of `Y_{𝒫'}` to the fibres of `Wsh'`, and the two clauses
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.htyp` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle` — both of which read the original-coordinate
shading against the rescaled plank family — would be unreachable. It is consumed through
`Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.congr_image` and
`ShadedBody.HasCConstantMultiplicity.congr_image`. -/

  is the upper pin on `b'` that the clause
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverseFill_fullness` (O5) demands — without it that clause is refuted at `b' = 1`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.false_of_transverseFill_fullness`); a lower pin alone does not

  hwin : Plank.IsWindowedFamily bodies' P
  /-- **The plank of `L_B(W)` is built on the frame of `W` itself**.

  This is the clause that makes the plank angles of blueprint `def:typicalAnglePlank` *equal*
  to the body angles of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle`, and hence the clause that makes the
  field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle` — the display `anglebound`, the only
  form in which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` uses typicality — reachable at
  all.

  Without it the two sides are incomparable. `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` measures
  `Kakeya.Prism3D.angle`, i.e. the angle between the planks' `basis 0`; `axisAngle` measures
  the angle between the bodies' `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`. An enclosure
  `L_B '' (Wb j).carrier ⊆ (P j).carrier` pins the two only to within an angle `≍ C(C₀) a/b`,
  and the aperture budget of the tangential case has no room for that. What repairs it is that
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure` accepts a *prescribed* frame and this assembly
  hands it `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyFrame (Wb j)`, transported unchanged by the homothety
  `L_B`, which does not rotate. With `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyFrame_zero` the identification
  `(P j).basis 0 = n(Wb j)` is then exact. -/

  hselRefine : ShadedBody.IsCRefinement sel YP bodies' YP (plankSelectionConstant C₀)⁻¹
  /-- **The rescaling multiplies every shaded volume by `(2 r₁)⁻³`**.

  The normalizing scale is `2 r₁` and not `r₁`: the shaded bodies `Y_{𝕎'_B}(W)` are the
  *enlargements* `N_{τ₂(W)}(W)` of the geometric bodies of (C4), and those do not fit in
  `B̄(ctr, r₁)`. Only the clauses that mention the
  rescaling map record the doubled scale; the dimension clauses `hratio`, `hlower`, `hupper`,
  `hblower`, `hbupper` and `hδa'` are unchanged, because by blueprint `lem:ml2thicknessDouble` the
  doubling of the scale is exactly cancelled by the doubling of the comparison constant.

  `L_B` is an exact homothety of ratio `(2 r₁)⁻¹` followed by a translation, so it scales every
  volume by the same factor. This is the only quantitative trace of the transport that a
  consumer of the bundle needs, and it is what lets
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` read the fullness obligation (O5) of
  Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, which the blueprint states in the original coordinates,
  against the plank family, where `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` consumes it.
  The affine map itself is not a parameter of this structure, so the identity is recorded
  rather than the map. -/

  `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` carrying local volume estimates with it.

  **The fourth clause is the bridge unrolled once** (blueprint `plankRescalingBridge`, second
  level). The transverse case refines *twice* in plank coordinates — once to produce the
  typical angle, and once more inside `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` — and it
  must relate the second pull-back to the *first* one, i.e. to the very family `Y_{𝕎''_B}` the
  bundle `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData` carries. The three clauses above cannot do
  that: they produce `Wsh'` from `YP'` and hide the transporting map behind an `∃ g`, so a
  second application of the same clause produces a family related to a *fresh* map and to the
  original `Wsh`, not to `Wsh'`. The fourth clause is stated relative to the `Wsh'` produced by
  the first, which is what makes the two levels composable.

  It is phrased through the shadings alone — a containment and a mass bound rather than
  `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement` — because at the second level the refining family arrives with
  the *plank* carriers demanded by `ShadedBody.IsRefinement` inside
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle`, while `YP'` carries the rescaled bodies;
  the two are shading-congruent and nothing else of them is used. -/

/-- **The rescaling bridge, unrolled once** (blueprint `plankRescalingBridge`, second level).

The fourth clause of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hbridge`, isolated: given the
first pull-back `Wsh'` of `YP'`, whose shadings are related by the fixed affine map
`L_B⁻¹ = (plankRescale ctr _).symm`, a further refinement `Z` of `YP'` — recorded through its
shadings alone, since at the call site it arrives with the plank carriers that
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` produces — pulls back to a `c₂`-refinement `Z'`
of `(t, Wsh')` transporting local volume estimates, exactly as the first level does.

Every step is the first level's: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.volume_plankRescale_symm_image` for the
mass comparison, which is exact because `L_B⁻¹` multiplies every volume by the same `r₁³`, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankRescalingBridge` for the transport of the ball estimate. -/

/-! ### Attaching a shading to a plank family

`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` consumes a plank family *with its shading
attached* (`ShadedPlank`), and its refinement hypothesis `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement` demands
the carriers of the refining family to be *equal* to the planks. The plank presentation of
blueprint `lem:ml2plankpresentation` produces a bare plank family `𝒫` and a shading `Y_𝒫`
carried by the *rescaled bodies*, so both objects have to be re-carried once. The two
definitions below do exactly that, and nothing else: outside the index set on which the
shading is known to sit inside the plank they shade nothing, which is the only way to make
`ShadedBody.shade_subset` unconditional. -/

/-- **Presenting the factoring bodies as a plank family**.

Let `L_B` be the affine change of variables taking the `r₁`-ball `B` (here the ball of radius
`r₁` centred at `ctr`) to the unit ball, and set `𝒫 = L_B(𝕎'_B)`, `Y_𝒫 = L_B(Y_{𝕎'_B})`,
`a' = a / r₁`, `b' = b / r₁`. By (C4) each `W ∈ 𝕎_B` has affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)`,
so `L_B(W)` has affine thicknesses `∼ (1, b', a')`, i.e. is contained in an `a' × b' × 1`
plank with the *same* aspect ratio `a'/b' = a/b` — the ratio the transverse and tangential
cases consume through their hypothesis `hratio`. The dimensions of the plank are only
comparable to `a/r₁` and `b/r₁`, with the constant `C₀` of (C4); this is the content of the
two-sided bound on `a'` below.

The bodies of `𝕎_B` are the blocks of a factoring of `𝕋_B`, hence pairwise essentially
distinct, and an affine map preserves essential distinctness; the containment
`Y_{𝕎'_B}(W) ⊆ W` is part of the construction in blueprint
`factoringAndMultPropCombined`. Since `L_B` multiplies all volumes by the same factor, the
ratio defining `μ` and the ratios defining a `c`-refinement are unchanged, which is the last
clause: a `c`-refinement of `(𝒫, Y_𝒫)` pulls back to a `c`-refinement of
`(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`.

**The rescaling bridge.** The pull-back of the previous paragraph also transports *local
volume estimates*, and this is the clause the transverse case consumes. Writing `Wsh'` for the
`c`-refinement of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` produced
from a `c`-refinement `YP'` of `(𝒫, Y_𝒫)`, then for every centre `x'`, every *pair* of radii
`r'`, `s'` and every `K ∈ [0, ∞]`,

`K |B̄(x', r')| ≤ |U(𝒫', Y_{𝒫'}) ∩ B̄(x', s')|` implies
`∃ x, K |B(x, r₁ r')| ≤ |U(𝕎''', Y_{𝕎'''}) ∩ B(x, r₁ s')|`.

Two radii appear because the estimate to be transported — Item 1 of
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` — compares the volume of a ball of one radius with the shaded
mass in a concentric ball of a *larger* one. No comparison constant is lost: `L_B` is an exact
homothety of ratio `r₁⁻¹` followed by a translation, so it multiplies every volume by the same
factor `r₁³` and the ratio `K` is preserved exactly. The constant `C₀` of (C4) enters only
through the *dimensions*, `r₁ b' ∈ [C₀⁻¹ b, C₀ b]`, so a radius `r'` comparable to `θ b'`
transports to a radius comparable to `θ b`, and not to `θ b` itself; this is why
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill` asks for its conclusion at *some* radius `r ≥ θ b`.
The hypothesis is stated for closed balls and the conclusion for open ones, which is what the
consumer needs and costs nothing, spheres being Lebesgue null in `ℝ³`.

The affine change of variables is `L_B = (· - ctr) ∘ (homothety ctr r₁⁻¹)`, i.e. a homothety
followed by a translation, so the statement is the composition of six independent facts, each
of which is now available as its own lemma:

* `ShadedBody.affineImage` / `ShadedBody.homothety` construct `L_B(Y_{𝕎'_B})`; only
  `ShadedBody.vadd` and `ShadedBody.translate` existed before;
* `IsEssentiallyDistinct.image_homothety` (with `IsEssentiallyDistinct.image_add_left` for the
  translation part) gives the essential-distinctness clause;
* `ShadedBody.multiplicity_homothety` (with `ShadedBody.multiplicity_translate_const`) gives
  `μ(𝒫, Y_𝒫) = μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`;
* `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.comap_homothety` gives the last clause, in the pull-back
  direction; note that `ShadedBody.IsRefinement` demands the carriers to be *equal*, which is
  why the statement produces a shading on the very bodies `Wb j`;
* `Kakeya.maxDensity_homothety` transfers `Δ_max(𝕎_B)` to the plank family, which is what
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard` consumes through its `hdens`; the passage from the
  transported bodies to the planks containing them costs the factor
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureConstant C₀` of
  `Kakeya.maxDensity_le_of_carrier_subset`, exactly as in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure`;
* `Prism3D.exists_superset_of_hasThicknesses` turns the transported body, whose affine
  thicknesses are `∼ (1, b/r₁, a/r₁)` by `LipschitzWith.ethickness_image_le` applied to `L_B`
  and to `L_B⁻¹` (together with `Metric.ethickness_thickness'`), into an `a' × b' × 1` plank
  containing it.

**The two clauses `plankCard` consumes.** `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard` needs to know both
where the planks live and how densely they are packed, and neither is recoverable from the
clauses above; they are therefore part of the conclusion.

* *Localization.* The planks lie in `B̄(0, plankBallRadius)`, not in the unit ball: `L_B(W)`
  does lie in `B̄(0,1)` by `hin`, but the plank is a superset of it. See
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankBallRadius` for the elementary bound, and for why the enlargement
  is free downstream. The clause is stated as `Plank.IsWindowedFamily` rather than as a bare
  containment, because `plankBallRadius` derives from `Plank.windowRadius`: it is in this form that
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` consumes it, and stating it at any larger radius would leave
  that hypothesis undischarged.
* *Density.* `Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ C_{lem:ml2plankpresentation}(C₀) Δ_max(𝕎'_B)`, which is
  `Kakeya.maxDensity_homothety` for the rescaling followed by
  `Kakeya.maxDensity_le_of_carrier_subset` for the enclosure. Note that this is an inequality
  and not the equality that holds for `μ`: `μ` sees only the shadings, which the enclosure does
  not touch, whereas `Δ_max` sees the carriers, which it enlarges. Composed with (C4)'s
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering` — through
  `Kakeya.maxDensity_mono` along `bodies'_subset` — it gives the plank family the
  unconditional density bound `Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ C(C₀) C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}` that
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` feeds to `plankCard`.

**Two families, and the doubled scale.** The shaded bodies `Y_{𝕎'_B}(W)` of the corrected
factoring proposition are *enlargements* `N_{τ₂(W)}(W)` of the geometric bodies of (C4), not the
bodies themselves; that is the sandwich `hWbW` / `hWcth`, which replaces the former (false)
equality `(Wsh j).toConvexSpaceBody = Wb j`. Two consequences shape the assembly.

* *Two families are passed to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFamilyEnclosure`.* The planks must
  enclose the **enlarged** carriers, since it is their shadings that are transported; but
  pairwise essential distinctness is available only for the **geometric** bodies and is in
  general false for their neighbourhoods. So the enclosure family is
  `fun j ↦ (Wsh j).toConvexSpaceBody.plankRescale …` and the essentially-distinct core family
  is `fun j ↦ (Wb j).plankRescale …`, related by `hK₀K` from `hWbW`. Nothing is lost: the
  selection only ever needs *some* large essentially distinct core inside each plank.
* *The normalizing scale is `2 r₁`, not `r₁`.* By `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.scale_le_of_hasThicknesses`
  the enlargement radius is at most `C₀ a ≤ C₀ b ≤ r₁`, so the enlarged carriers lie in
  `B̄(ctr, 2 r₁)` (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.enlarged_subset_closedBall`) and in no smaller ball of
  the form `B̄(ctr, r₁)`; the long half-width of a `Kakeya.Plank` is fixed at `1`, so no choice
  of plank dimensions could compensate. **The plank dimensions do not move**: the geometry runs
  at the doubled comparison constant `2 C₀` (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_double`) and
  the doubled scale `2 r₁`, and `2 C₀ · (a / (2 r₁)) = C₀ a / r₁ = a'`, so the two doublings
  cancel. The selection keeps the constants of (C4), because
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.enclosureVolumeConstant_two_le_plankEnclosureConstant` absorbs the
  doubled geometric constant into `plankEnclosureConstant C₀`. Only the clauses of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData` that mention the rescaling map —
  `hvol` and `hbridge` — record the doubled scale.

**The two obligations.** Two hypotheses of the assembly are *not* supplied by Configurations
`hyp:ml2setup` and `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, and are carried here as explicit hypotheses rather than
silently assumed (blueprint, note following `lem:ml2plankpresentation`).

* (O1) is `hbr₁`, stated in the sharpened form `C₀ * b ≤ r₁` rather than `b ≤ r₁`: the middle
  thickness of `L_B(W)` is only known to be at most `C₀ * (b / r₁)`, so `b ≤ r₁` alone does not
  give `b' ≤ 1`, which the type `Plank a' b'` requires. Together with `1 ≤ C₀` it implies
  `b ≤ r₁`. At the call site it is a smallness condition on `δ`, since `b ≤ δ^{2 exscal}` and
  `r₁ = δ^{exscal}`.
* (O2) is `hUpos`, the positivity `|U(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})| > 0`. It is the side condition of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.multiplicity_plankRescale`, and it is the *only* route to the field
  `PlankPresentationData.hmult`; without it that field is unreachable. By `UTY` the shaded
  union is `⋃_W Y_{𝕎'_B}(W)`, so the condition says exactly that some shading has positive
  measure. -/

/-! The cardinality data `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCardExponent` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCardConstant` of the bound below are declared in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankConstants`, upstream of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, because the eleventh clause of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`
names them: they are the cardinality data at which the transverse branch invokes the
plank-to-slab reduction. -/

/-- **Polynomial cardinality bound for the plank family**.

Cover the ball `B̄(0, plankBallRadius)`, in which the planks of `𝒫` live by the
`Plank.IsWindowedFamily` clause of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` (the hypothesis
`hin` here, `plankBallRadius` deriving from `Plank.windowRadius` by definition), by a family of
`≲ (δ')^{-M}` prisms, where
`M = plankCardExponent = exists_bounded_prism_discretization.M 3`, such that every plank of `𝒫`
lies in one of them (`Kakeya.exists_finite_test_family_maxDensity_closedBall`, applied at
`r = δ' ≤ a'`, which is the smallest affine thickness of a plank, and at `R = plankBallRadius`).
For each such prism `K`, the number of members of `𝒫` contained in `K` is at most
`Δ_max(𝒫)|K|/|P| ≲ Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ Δ`, which is the hypothesis `hdens`. Summing over the cover with
`Finset.card_biUnion_le_card_mul` gives `|𝒫| ≲ Δ (δ')^{-M}`.

**The density bound must remain an explicit factor.** A hypothesis
`Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ (δ')⁻¹` would allow the factor to be included in the exponent, but does not follow
from the configuration: the only density bound available is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering`, `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ≤ C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}`,
transported to `𝒫` by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`; and `C_bias` is documented as
possibly depending on `δ`, so `C(C₀) C_bias δ^{-2ϱ} ≤ (δ')⁻¹` is not a fixed-scale condition
and could not be discharged by any field of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`. Keeping `Δ` as a
parameter makes the lemma unconditional, and leaves the (genuine, but purely exponential)
conversion `δ^{-2ϱ} = (δ')^{-2ϱ/(1-exscal)} ≤ (δ')^{-4ϱ}` — valid since `exscal < 1/2` by
`params.scale` — to the caller, where `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` is in scope.

This is the cardinality bridge required by
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`, whose hypothesis `hcard` is exactly a bound
of this shape; the caller instantiates its `N` at
`plankCardExponent + 4ϱ` and its constant at `plankCardConstant * C(C₀) * C_bias`, both fixed
before the family. The conclusion is stated in `ℝ≥0` and not in `ℝ` for that reason: `hcard`
reads `(s.card : ℝ≥0) ≤ C₀ * δ ^ (-N)`, so the two match without a coercion lemma. -/

/-! #### The four pieces of Proposition `lem:ml2typicalangle`

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` is one application of
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`, but each of that lemma's hypotheses needs a
small argument of its own, and each is stated here so that the assembly reads as the single
application it is. -/

/-- **The elementary facts about the rescaled small scale `δ' = δ / r₁`.**

All seven are consequences of `r₁ = δ^{exscal}`, of `cfg.hδ`/`cfg.hδ1`, and of the
multiplicity threshold `hmult2`, which is what forces the *strict* inequalities: at `δ' = 1`
one would have `(δ')^{-η} = 1 < 2`. The last one, `exscal < 1`, is then
`δ < r₁ = δ^{exscal}` read with `0 < δ < 1`, and it is what keeps the exponent bookkeeping of

Two planks built on the frames of two bodies make the bodies' angle, by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.prism_angle_eq_axisAngle`; the only work is undoing the cap of
`Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle`, which is `1 ⊓ ((a'/b') ⊔ ∠)`. If `θ < 1` the cap is inactive and
`∠ ≤ θ ≤ Ctyp θ`; if `θ ≥ 1` the bound is free, `axisAngle ≤ π/2 ≤ 2 ≤ Ctyp θ`. This is why
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` enlarges the typicality constant by the
factor `2 ≥ π/2`, and it is what the thirteenth clause

/-- **The exponent bookkeeping of Proposition `lem:ml2typicalangle`**.

The three numerical clauses of the bundle, isolated from the geometry. `C` is the constant
that `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` produces at `ε = η/1024` and the small scale
`δ' = δ/r₁`, and `Csel` is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant bd.C₀`.

* The refinement factor is `c = C_sel⁻¹ C⁻¹ (δ')^{η/1024} ≥ δ^{exscal·η} (δ')^{η/512}`, and
  `(δ')^{η/512} = δ^{(1-exscal)η/512}`, so `c ≥ δ^{exscal·η + (1-exscal)η/512} ≥ δ^{2η}` because
  `0 < exscal < 1`. The exponent `η/1024` and not `η/512` is what leaves room for the factor `2`
  of the third clause.
* The typicality constant `Ctyp = 2 C (δ')^{-η/1024}` is at least `2`, since `C ≥ 1` and
  `δ' ≤ 1`; the factor `2 ≥ π/2` is what absorbs the cap of `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle` in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle_le_of_effectivePlankAngle_le`.
* And `Ctyp ≤ 2 (δ')^{-η/512} ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}`, the second step being exactly the thirteenth
  clause `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.typicalAngle_cap`, here the hypothesis `hcap_thr`.

`hCsel1 : 1 ≤ Csel` cannot be dropped, for the reason recorded on
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilyMult`: in `ℝ≥0` one has `0⁻¹ = 0`, so at `Csel = 0` the
first clause reads `δ^{2η} ≤ 0` while `hCsel`, an upper bound, is satisfied. At the call site
it is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.one_le_plankSelectionConstant`. -/

/-- **The fibre-level plank-angle bound transports along a shading image, at the same
constant.**

The exact analogue of `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.congr_image`, and with the same one-line
proof, for `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound`.  `HasMaxPlankAngleBound` sees the shading only
through `shadeFibre` — through *which indices shade a point* — so a bijection of the ambient
space moves it index for index, by `shadeFibre_congr_image`.  The planks are not moved.

**The constant `C` is carried through untouched, and that is the point of stating it.** The
transport is what lets the *absolute* bound `C = 1` produced by
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` in the rescaled coordinates be recorded, in
the original coordinates, on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hmaxAbs`; before this lemma
the only route across the coordinate change was
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle_of_maxPlankAngleBound`, which spends the bound and returns the
body-axis form at the *non-absolute* `Ctyp`. -/

/-- **The one-sided plank-angle bound, read on the bodies and in the original coordinates**
.

The field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle`, assembled from the last conclusion
`Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound` of `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`. Two
transports happen at once and neither costs anything.

* *Coordinates.* The bound is produced for the rescaled shading `Y'` and is wanted for the
  original-coordinate shading `YW = L_B⁻¹(Y')`. `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound` sees the shading
  only through `shadeFibre`, i.e. through which indices shade a point, and `L_B` is a
  bijection, so `shadeFibre_congr_image` moves it index for index. The planks are *not*
  moved: they are read in the rescaled coordinates on both sides.
* *Planks to bodies.* Each plank is built on the frame of its body (`hbasis`), so
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle_le_of_effectivePlankAngle_le` converts the plank angle into
  the body angle with no aperture loss, at the price of the factor `2` in `Ctyp`. -/

/-! ### Transporting the typicality data to the plank carriers

`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` reads the refinement, the constant multiplicity
and the typicality at families carried by the *planks*, while
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` produces them at families carried by the
rescaled bodies. The four lemmas below move each clause across; every one of them is a shading
congruence, the shadings being literally the same on the index set in play. -/

`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` demands its cardinality data *before* the

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.plankCard_bias` pays for `C(C₀) C_bias` at `δ^{-ϱ}`, leaving

The obligation is granted in the original coordinates, as the clause

coordinates by `hvol`, and the shadings of the plank family are the transports of
`Y_{𝕎'_B}`, which is `hvol` again. The upper pin on `b'` is `hbupper`, and the transverse
guard `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ 1` of the clause is the hypothesis `hguard`,

/-- **A typical angle of intersection in the non-slab case**.

In the configuration `cfg`, with the per-ball data `bd` of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, the
thin-case data `tc` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over it, the thin-case refinement
`a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` and the non-slab hypothesis `b ≤ δ^{2·exscal}`, fix a ball `B ∈ 𝔅` and suppose
that the factoring multiplicity satisfies `δ^{-η} ≤ μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`. Then there are

* a finite essentially distinct family `𝒫` of `a' × b' × 1` planks with `a'/b' = a/b`,
  together with a shading `Y_𝒫`, obtained from `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` as in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`;
* a `⪆ 1` refinement of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`, expressed here as an `IsCRefinement` with
  constant `c ≥ δ^{2η}`; and
* an angle `θ ∈ [a/b, 1]`

such that `θ` is a typical angle for the refined family in the sense of
`Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle`, with the comparison constant `Ctyp` exposed and stopping-time
scale `Real.toNNReal (Kakeya.plankAngleScaleA a')`. The range of `θ` and constant-multiplicity
conclusion, which the former typical-angle predicate bundled, are separate fields.

All of that is the single bundle `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData cfg tc hB τ'`, and the
conclusion is its `Nonempty`. The bundle exists because the same fourteen clauses are
consumed verbatim by three declarations — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` — and listing them at each was three copies of
one concept.

**The typicality constant is bounded, and must be.** `Ctyp` is existentially quantified here,
*after* `cfg` and hence after `δ`, so without a bound on it the last two clauses carry no
information at all: `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` and `ShadedBody.HasCConstantMultiplicity` both
become weaker as the constant grows, and are satisfied by any family once it is large enough.
The clause bounding `Ctyp` is what keeps them non-vacuous, and it is what the consumers
consume: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill` carries it as the hypothesis `hCtyp`, without
which its own typicality hypothesis would say nothing and the lemma would be unprovable rather
than merely unproved.

The bound is the *sharp* one of blueprint `typicalAngleConstantBoundSharp`, stated at the
rescaled scale `δ' = δ / r₁ = δ^{1-exscal}` and at the exponent `η/256`:
`Ctyp ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}`. It is not the weaker `Ctyp ≤ δ^{-η}` that this statement used to carry,
and the difference is forced by the exponent gap `128ε ≤ ε'` of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab`:
with `ε' = η/2` fixed by the sixth clause
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverse_fill`, the `ε` at which
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill` applies that lemma is at most `ε'/2 = η/256`, so a bound
at `δ^{-η}` would not discharge its constant-bound hypothesis and the transverse chain would
not close. Note that the sharp bound implies the weak one, `(δ')^{-η/256} ≤ δ^{-η}` for
`0 < δ ≤ 1`, since `(1-exscal)η/256 ≤ η`.

That clause is now derivable. `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` binds its constant
`C` *inside* the `∀ δ`, after `δ` is introduced, and carries `C ≤ δ^{-ε}` as a conclusion; the
proposition applies it at an `ε` small compared with `η` — `ε = η/1024` is comfortable — an
exponent fixed before the scale either way, so it costs nothing.

**The state of the four obligations.** All four are discharged; the fourth only after the
bundle's fullness clause was restated at the exponent the configuration supports.

* *Discharged (statement of Section 6).* `TypicalAngleData.hCtyp`, `Ctyp ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}`, and
  `TypicalAngleData.hc`, `δ^{2η} ≤ c`, both bottomed out on an upper bound for the constant that
  `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` produces. That lemma is now stated per
  scale with the growth clause `C ≤ δ^{-ε}`; at `ε = η/1024` it gives
  `Ctyp ≍ C (δ')^{-ε} ≤ (δ')^{-η/512}` and
  `c = C^{sel-1} C^{-1} (δ')^{ε} ≥ δ^{exscal·η} (δ')^{η/512} ≥ δ^{2η}`, using `exscal < 1/2`.
* *Discharged (hypothesis `hsel_thr` below).* `hthr` of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilyMult`,
  `(plankSelectionConstant bd.C₀ : ℝ) ≤ (cfg.δ : ℝ)^{-exscal·η}`, is blueprint
  `typicalAngleSelectionThreshold`. It is now the twelfth clause
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.typicalAngle_selection`, which the single call site
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` already carries, and it reaches this
  statement as the hypothesis `hsel_thr`. The module layering that blocked it is gone:
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant` now lives in
  `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankConstants`, upstream of `CaseScale`.
* *Discharged (prescribed frames).* `TypicalAngleData.hangle`, blueprint `anglebound`, asks for
  a bound on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle (bd.Wb i) (bd.Wb j)`, while `htyp` bounds
  `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle (P i) (P j)`. The two are now *the same angle*:
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure` builds its plank on a **prescribed** orthonormal
  frame, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` hands it
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyFrame (bd.Wb j)` — transported unchanged by the homothety `L_B`,
  which does not rotate — and the resulting identification is the field
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hbasis`, converted by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.prism_angle_eq_axisAngle`.

  One quantitative step remains inside that conversion, and it is what the thirteenth clause
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.typicalAngle_cap` (hypothesis `hcap_thr` below) buys.
  `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle` *caps* at `1`, so `effectivePlankAngle (P i) (P j) ≤ Ctyp θ`
  carries no information once `Ctyp θ ≥ 1`, whereas `axisAngle ≤ π/2 > 1`. Enlarging `Ctyp` by
  the factor `2 ≥ π/2` closes the gap — `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.mono` and
  `ShadedBody.HasCConstantMultiplicity.mono` make that free — and `hcap_thr` is what keeps the
  enlarged constant inside the `(δ')^{-η/256}` budget of `hCtyp`.

* *Discharged (at the exponent the configuration supports).* `TypicalAngleData.hfull` used to
  ask for `(a')^η ≤ λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`, and *no* choice of the refinement can supply that.
  The only lower bound on fullness in the configuration is (T2),
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies`: `δ^{6η} ≤ C · λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` at the `tb`
  index `2η`. Passing to a
  `c`-refinement costs a further factor `c ≤ 1`
  (`ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.mul_fullness_le`, which is sharp), so the best available is
  `λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B}) ≥ c C^{-1} δ^{6η}`. But `a' ≥ δ/r₁ = δ^{1-exscal}` — this is
  `PlankPresentationData.hδa'` — so `(a')^η ≥ δ^{(1-exscal)η} > δ^{6η}` for `0 < δ < 1`, since
  `(1-exscal)η < 6η`. The gap is a positive power of `δ`, so no constant absorbs it and no
  smallness hypothesis on `δ` repairs it either: shrinking `δ` makes it worse. The blueprint
  reaches the same conclusion in the closing note of `lem:ml2typicalangle` ("what this
  proposition does *not* produce"), where the `(a')^η` fullness is declared a mathematical
  input required of whatever produces the bodies.

  The field is therefore now stated at the exponent the configuration does support,
  `δ^{8η} ≤ C λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` — (T2) at the `tb` index `2η` for the bodies and `δ^{2η}`
  for the refinement —
  and it is discharged by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.typicalAngleRefinedFullness`. The matching
  binders of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseMassBall` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill` moved with it; the obligation that remains, and
  that is now visible where it belongs, is on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill`, which
  must reach `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` from the weaker fullness or else receive the
  `(a')^η` form as a genuine input from further up.

This is `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` applied with small scale `δ' = δ/r₁` and
`ε = η/1024`: its multiplicity hypothesis follows from `hmult` together with
`μ(𝒫, Y_𝒫) = μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` and `δ' ≥ δ`, and its cardinality bridge is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard`. The output data are exactly what the transverse and
tangential cases (`goalMult_of_theta_ge`, `goalMult_of_theta_lt`) consume.

**The cardinality bridge needs no extra hypothesis.** `plankCard` asks for the localization
`𝒫 ⊆ B̄(0, plankBallRadius)` and for a density bound `Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ Δ`; both are clauses of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`, the second with
`Δ = plankEnclosureConstant bd.C₀ * Δ_max(𝕎'_B)`, and `Δ_max(𝕎'_B) ≤ C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}` is
`bd.bodies_antiClustering` restricted along `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'_subset` by
`Kakeya.maxDensity_mono`. The resulting bound `|𝒫| ≲ δ^{-2ϱ} (δ')^{-plankCardExponent}` is
turned into the shape `hcard` demands — a constant fixed *before* the scale, times a power of
`δ'` — by `δ^{-2ϱ} = (δ')^{-2ϱ/(1-exscal)} ≤ (δ')^{-4ϱ}`, using `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` and
`exscal < 1/2` (`params.scale`); so `N = plankCardExponent + 4ϱ`.

**A note on coordinates.** The typicality clause pairs the *original-coordinate* shading `YW`
on `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'` with the *rescaled* plank family `P`. This is not a coordinate
error, and it is equivalent to the blueprint's fully rescaled formulation: `IsTypicalPlankAngle`
sees the shading only through `ShadedBody.shadeFibre`, i.e. through *which indices* shade a
given point, and `L_B` is a bijection, so it carries the fibres of `Y_{𝒫'}` onto the fibres of
`YW` index for index. The angles are read off `P` alone, and `L_B` is a homothety, so it
preserves them. Carrying the pair in this mixed form is what lets the transverse case state its
conclusions about `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'` and `cfg.b` directly, instead of re-rescaling at
every step.

The data `𝕎'_B`, `W`, `Y_{𝕎'_B}` and the centre of the ball are read off `bd` and
`tc.thinBall hB` instead of being taken freely: `bodies' = (tc.thinBall hB).bodies'`,
`Wb = bd.Wb`, `Wsh = (tc.thinBall hB).W`, `ctr = bd.ctr B`. Consequently the hypotheses
`hC₀`, `ctr`, `hin`, `hthick` of the previous statement are dropped: they are
`bd.hC₀`, `bd.bodies_subset_ball` and `bd.bodies_thickness`
restricted along `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'_subset`, and the enlargement sandwich is
`(tc.thinBall hB).Wb_le_W` / `(tc.thinBall hB).W_le_cthickening`. The remaining hypotheses are
the ones the bundle does *not*
supply: the positivity of `τ`, the thin-case and non-slab dichotomy hypotheses, the
large-multiplicity hypothesis `hmult` of this branch, and three fixed-scale conditions on `δ`.

The two positivity hypotheses `0 < δ'` and `0 < a'` of
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` need no assumption:
`δ' = δ / r₁ > 0` by `cfg.hδ` together with `r₁ = δ^{exscal} > 0`, and `δ' ≤ a'` is part of the
conclusion of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`. The remaining four have no source in `cfg`, `bd` or
`tc`, and each is a genuine smallness condition in `δ`, which is legitimate because
`Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge` is stated `∀ᶠ (δ : NNReal) in 𝓝[>] 0`. They
are therefore explicit, one per condition:

* `hbsmall : bd.C₀ * cfg.b ≤ cfg.r₁` is `plankPresentation`'s `hbr₁`; it is what forces
  `b' ≤ 1`, i.e. what makes the planks *planks*. It holds for small `δ` because
  `b ≤ δ^{2 exscal}` and `r₁ = δ^{exscal}`, so it amounts to `bd.C₀ δ^{exscal} ≤ 1`.
* `hasmall : bd.C₀ * (cfg.a / cfg.r₁) ≤ exp (-1)` discharges *two* conditions at once, and is
  stated in this single form for that reason. It gives `a' < 1`, which is
  `findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection`'s `ha1`; and it gives `1 ≤ log (a')⁻¹`, whence
  `exp ((log (a')⁻¹)^{1/4}) ≤ exp ((log (a')⁻¹)^{1/2}) =
  Real.toNNReal (Kakeya.plankAngleScaleA a')`, which is the `A`-clause of
  `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` for the scale
  `findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection` actually produces. It holds for small `δ` because
  `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` and `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` with `τ + exscal < 1`, the field
  `params.thinScale`, so `a / r₁ ≤ δ^{1-τ-exscal} → 0`.
* `hmult2 : 2 ≤ (δ')^{-η}` is `findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection`'s `hμ2`. It holds for small
  `δ` because `δ' = δ^{1-exscal} → 0` and `η > 0`.

The fourth condition, the sub-polynomial bound `C ≤ (δ')^{-ε}` on the constant produced, is
*not* a hypothesis here: it is a conclusion of
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`, and it is precisely what makes the two
clauses `δ^{2η} ≤ c` and `Ctyp ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}` provable. The exponent at which the proposition
applies that lemma is `ε = η/1024`, and the whole computation is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.typicalAngleArith`: with
`c = (C^{sel})⁻¹ C⁻¹ (δ')^{η/1024} ≥ δ^{exscal·η} (δ')^{η/512} ≥ δ^{2η}` and
`Ctyp = 2 C (δ')^{-η/1024} ≤ 2 (δ')^{-η/512} ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}`, the last step being `hcap_thr`. The
value `η/1024` rather than `η/512` is forced by that factor `2`: at `ε = η/512` the bound on `Ctyp`
would land at `2 (δ')^{-η/256}` and miss `hCtyp` by exactly the factor the cap of
`Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle` costs.

**The two plank-side clauses.** The localization `Plank.IsWindowedFamily` and the pairwise
essential distinctness of the plank *carriers* are passed through from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` rather than dropped. They say nothing about the
angle, and the typical-angle argument does not use them; they are here because they are two of
the hypotheses of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab`, which
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill` has to discharge and which are not recoverable from a
freely given plank family. The windowedness is stated at `Plank.windowRadius`, which is what
`plankBallRadius` is defined to be; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankBallRadius`.

The fullness clause `(a')^η ≤ λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` is here for the same reason, and is the
third hypothesis of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` that a freely given family cannot supply.
It is carried, in `hO5` and in the field `hfullP` it produces, only under the transverse-case
guard, since that is the
only regime in which it is read; the guard of the field implies the guard of the clause by
`hθ1 : θ ≤ 1`.
It is stated at the *refined* shading `YW` and so is not simply `ThinBall.fullness_bodies`:
discharging it means propagating that fullness through the `⪆ 1` refinement produced with
`θ`, which costs a positive power of `δ` and is the reason the clause is asserted here, where
`YW` is produced, rather than assumed by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill`. Asserting it

/-! ### Assembling the non-slab case -/

/-- **Exponent in Lemma `lem:ml2bigmult`**.

`ν_{lem:ml2bigmult}(β, ζ) = min(½ τ' β, ½ exscal β ζ)`, where `½ τ' β` is a lower bound for
the gain `τ' β - O(τ + η)` of the transverse case
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge` (using `params.transverse`) and `½ exscal β ζ` is
the gain of the tangential case `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`.

The blueprint treats the parameters of `hyp:ml2params` as fixed once and for all, so it
writes the constant as a function of `β` and `ζ` alone; in Lean the coarse-scale exponent
`exscal` and the transversality exponent `τ'` are separate reals, so they appear as explicit
arguments. -/
noncomputable def bigmultExponent (β ζ exscal τ' : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  min (τ' * β / 2) (exscal * β * ζ / 2)

/-- The exponent `ν_{lem:ml2bigmult}` is positive. -/
lemma bigmultExponent_pos {β ζ exscal τ' : ℝ} (hβ : 0 < β) (hζ : 0 < ζ)
    (hexscal : 0 < exscal) (hτ' : 0 < τ') : 0 < bigmultExponent β ζ exscal τ' :=
  lt_min (by positivity) (by positivity)

/-- **Main Lemma 2, non-slab case with large factoring multiplicity**.

With the hypotheses of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`, in particular
`δ^{-η} ≤ μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` at a ball `B ∈ 𝔅` maximising the factoring multiplicity, the
goal holds with exponent `ν = ν_{lem:ml2bigmult}`.

Let `θ ∈ [a/b, 1]` and the refinement be produced by `exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`. Either
`θ ≥ δ^{-τ'} a/b`, and we are in the transverse case: `goalMult_of_theta_ge` gives the
density estimate with exponent `τ' β - O(τ + η) ≥ ½ τ' β`. Or `θ < δ^{-τ'} a/b`, and we are
in the tangential case: `goalMult_of_theta_lt` gives the goal with exponent `½ exscal β ζ`.
In either case the exponent is at least `ν_{lem:ml2bigmult}`, and since `0 < δ ≤ 1` the map
`s ↦ δ^s` is antitone.

As in `exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`, the family `𝕎'_B` and its shading are read off
`tc.thinBall hB`, and the hypotheses `hC₀`, `ctr`, `hin`, `hthick`, the enlargement sandwich
`hWbW`/`hWcth`, and `hed` of the previous statement are dropped, being supplied by `bd` and by
the `ThinBall` at `B`. The only
hypotheses that remain are `hmult` — the large-multiplicity hypothesis distinguishing this
branch — `hβ1` and `hBmax`, which both angular leaves need for
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound`, the tangential-leaf bundle
`tin : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TangentialInputs cfg tc τ'` of blueprint `lem:ml2tangential`(a)–(c),
threaded on to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt` and received from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_b_le`, and
`scale : CaseScale cfg bd τ τ' (τ' * cfg.β / 2) tc.C thr`. Three fields of
`scale` are consumed by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`;
`scale.rho2Star_le_one` controls the dilated angular scale in both angular leaves,
`scale.transverse_radius` is the transfer-radius threshold of the transverse leaf, and
`scale.transverse_ballFill` and `scale.aScaleData_threshold` are spent further down that
leaf. The gain indexing `scale` is the transverse gain `τ'β/2` and not a free `νA` because
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge` reads the eighth clause at the gain at which it
invokes `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`; the tangential leaf places no constraint
on it. -/

/-- **Main Lemma 2, non-slab case**.

In the configuration `cfg`, with the per-ball data `bd` of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` and
the thin-case data `tc` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over it, together with the
thin-case refinement `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`, suppose we are in the *non-slab case*, i.e. the middle
affine thickness of the factoring bodies satisfies `b ≤ δ^{exscal} r₁ = δ^{2·exscal}`. Then
the goal holds with the positive gain `ν = ν_{lem:ml2nonslab}(β, ζ)` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabExponent`.

No distinguished ball is taken: this lemma *picks* one, and it is the unique place in the
non-slab case where the choice is made. `𝔅 = bd.bs` is a non-empty `Finset` by
`bd.bs_nonempty`, so maximising over `bd.bs.attach` supplies a `B ∈ 𝔅` maximising
`μ((tc.thinBall hB).bodies', (tc.thinBall hB).W)`, and both branches use only this one ball.
The maximality is passed on as the hypothesis `hBmax` of the two branches, which need it for
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound`; taking an arbitrary ball here would leave that
hypothesis undischarged. Then `le_total` on `δ^{-η}` splits: either `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ δ^{-η}` and
`goalMult_of_multBodies_le` gives the goal with exponent `exscal · β`, or
`μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≥ δ^{-η}` and `goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` gives it with exponent
`ν_{lem:ml2bigmult}`. In either case the exponent is at least `ν`, and since `0 < δ ≤ 1` the
map `s ↦ δ^s` is antitone.

Together with `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge` (the slab case) this completes the thin case
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`, whose gain is witnessed by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinExponent cfg.β cfg.ζ cfg.exscal τ'`, the minimum of the slab gain
`β/2` and `nonslabExponent cfg.β cfg.ζ cfg.exscal τ'`.

The bundle `scale : CaseScale cfg bd τ τ' (τ' * cfg.β / 2) tc.C thr` is threaded to the
large-multiplicity branch
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` and consumed in the angular argument; only
`scale.rho2Star_le_one` is also needed by the small-multiplicity branch. So is the
tangential-leaf bundle `tin : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TangentialInputs cfg tc τ'`, which travels
untouched from `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le` to
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`; the ball `B` chosen here is the one at which its
`slab` field is eventually read. -/
