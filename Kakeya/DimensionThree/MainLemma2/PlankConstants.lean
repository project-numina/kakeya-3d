# The two named constants of the plank presentation

This file carries the constants `C_{lem:ml2plankpresentation}(C₀)` (blueprint
`def:ml2plankEnclosureConstant`, Lean `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureConstant`) and
`C^{sel}(C₀)` (blueprint `def:ml2plankSelectionConstant`, Lean
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant`), together with the absolute clustering dilation
constant that the second is built from.

**Why they live here and not with their consumers.** Both are mentioned by fields of
Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`, i.e. by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.ThinConfig`: `plankEnclosureConstant` by the tenth clause
`plankCard_bias`, and `plankSelectionConstant` by the twelfth,
`typicalAngle_selection`, which is the blueprint's `typicalAngleSelectionThreshold` and the
threshold that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilyMult` consumes as its `hthr`. Their natural
home would be `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankPresentation`, where the lemmas that
produce them live — but that file *imports* `ThinConfig`, so a `CaseScale` clause could not
mention them. Neither constant names any data beyond `C₀`, so both are free to sit at this
earlier point, upstream of `ThinConfig`; that is the whole content of this file's existence.

Only the *definitions* move. Every lemma that uses these constants geometrically —
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilySelection`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureVolume` — stays in `PlankPresentation`.

/-! ### The enclosure constant -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2plankpresentation`**.

`C_{lem:ml2plankpresentation}(C₀)` is the volume loss incurred when the rescaled factoring
body `L_B(W)`, whose affine thicknesses are only *comparable* to `(1, b', a')` with the
constant `C₀` of (C4), is replaced by an exact `a' × b' × 1` plank containing it. It bounds
the ratio `|P| / |L_B(W)|` for the plank `P` produced by
`Prism3D.exists_superset_of_hasThicknesses`, and hence the loss in `Δ_max` when the family
`𝕎'_B` is replaced by the plank family `𝒫`.

It is the exact analogue of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosureConstant`, which plays the
same role for the prism enclosure of the slab case, and is given the same provisional value:
`Prism3D.enclosureVolumeConstant C₀ = 48 C₀⁶` is the honest bound for a single body, and the
displayed value leaves room for the fixed dimensional factors of the passage to `Δ_max`.

It lives here, upstream of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, because the tenth clause
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.plankCard_bias` of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` mentions it; a
constant naming no data beyond `C₀` is free to sit at the earlier point. -/

/-! ### Bounded clustering: the dilation constant -/

/-- **A clustering dilation constant.**

`C` is a clustering dilation constant when `C ≥ 1` and any two rectangular prisms of `ℝ³` of
equal positive volume that fail to be essentially distinct lie in a common `C`-dilate of the
first. It is the one geometric input of the degree bound
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound`.

The predicate is separated from the constant `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.clusterDilationConstant`
that realises it because the convex-geometry statement it rests on,
`Kakeya.exists_essOverlapDilate_constant`, supplies its own constant existentially and no
value can be displayed. -/

/-- **Clustered planks lie in a common dilate**.

An absolute clustering dilation constant exists. The hypothesis inside
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsClusterDilationConstant` is equality of *volumes* and not of
half-widths, which is all the proof uses; at the call site the planks do have the same
half-widths `a' × b' × 1` and hence the common volume `8 a' b' > 0`. Positivity is not
decoration: at volume `0` no pair fails to be essentially distinct, so the statement would be
vacuous, but the case has to be excluded rather than argued. -/

It is obtained by choice from `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isClusterDilationConstant`, no
value being available: the convex-geometry input
`Kakeya.exists_essOverlapDilate_constant` is accepted as an assumption and supplies its
constant existentially. Naming it is what lets `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant` be stated as functions of `C₀` alone, as
blueprint `def:ml2plankSelectionConstant` requires; carrying it as a free parameter instead

/-! ### The selection constant -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2plankpresentation`** (blueprint
`def:ml2plankSelectionConstant`, `C^{sel}_{lem:ml2plankpresentation}`).

`C^{sel}(C₀) = D_{lem:ml2plankClusterBound}(C₀) + 1`, where `D_{lem:ml2plankClusterBound}(C₀)`
is the degree bound of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound` on the *clustering* relation
of the enclosing plank family: two indices are clustered when their planks fail to be
essentially distinct. It depends on `C₀`, on the ambient dimension — here fixed at `3` — and
on the absolute constant `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.clusterDilationConstant`, and on nothing else:
not on `δ`, not on the exponent parameters of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams`, not on the
ball `B`, not on the scales `a`, `b`, `r₁`, and not on the family. In particular it carries no
power of `δ`, so it is a multiplicative constant in the sense of the constant/exponent
distinction and is discharged where it is consumed rather than against an exponent budget.

The value is *not* provisional and must not be replaced by a polynomial in `C₀`: it is a tower
of exponentials in `C₀` (see `Kakeya.cardEssDistinctConvexInPrismConstant`), and anything
smaller than what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilySelection` can supply would make
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` false rather than merely unproved, a larger constant
giving a weaker refinement.

**Why this constant exists at all.** `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` used to assert
that the *enclosing* planks are pairwise essentially distinct. That assertion is **false**, for
every choice of the enclosing planks. Take `C₀²` pairwise disjoint boxes of half-widths
`(1/2, a'/C₀, 2a'/C₀²)` stacked along one axis so as to tile an interval of length `4a'`: they
are pairwise essentially distinct and have thicknesses comparable to `(1, b, a)` with constant
`C₀`, yet every enclosing plank of exact half-widths `(a', a', 1)` has extent `∼ a'` in the
stacking direction, so all `C₀²` planks are confined to a band of width `∼ 5a'` and at most
`O(1)` of them can be pairwise essentially distinct.

Enlarging a set does not preserve essential distinctness, and the enlargement is forced here by
`Plank` carrying *exact* thicknesses `![a, b, 1]`: a body whose thicknesses are merely
*comparable* to `(r₁, b, a)` — which is all (C4) supplies — is not a plank, so it has to be
enclosed in one. GWZ never performs that step; it uses the bodies themselves as planks up to
constants, and essential distinctness is then inherited. So this is a defect of the present
formalization and not of GWZ, whose Lemma 6.11 `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`
legitimately *assumes* an essentially distinct plank family.

The repair is to pass to a subfamily on which the planks *are* pairwise essentially distinct, at
the cost of a refinement factor. The clustering relation has degree at most `D(C₀)`: two planks
of equal volume overlapping in more than half of it lie in a common absolute dilate, inside
which only boundedly many pairwise essentially distinct bodies of volume
`≥ |P| / plankEnclosureConstant C₀` fit; and in any graph of degree at most `D` a greedy
selection in decreasing order of shaded mass keeps a `1/(D+1)` fraction of the total.

Note that the degree bound is a statement about *pairs*. It does **not** say that a point of
`ℝ³` lies in boundedly many of the planks — that is false for the same family, since pairwise
essential distinctness bounds pairwise intersections only and many sets can be pairwise
half-disjoint while sharing a common point. The selection is therefore run on the clustering
graph, and not on a pointwise multiplicity bound.

**Why it lives here.** The twelfth clause
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.typicalAngle_selection` of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`
 asserts `C^{sel}(C₀) ≤ δ^{-exscal·η}`, the
threshold that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilyMult` consumes; so this definition has to
sit upstream of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, exactly as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureConstant` does for the tenth clause. -/

/-! ### The cardinality data of the plank family, and the reduction threshold -/

/-- **Exponent in Lemma `lem:ml2plankcard`.**

The exponent in the polynomial cardinality bound `|𝒫| ≤ C (δ')^{-N}` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard`, named rather than written as a literal, following the
convention already used for `Kakeya.exists_bounded_prism_discretization.M` and
`Kakeya.exists_volume_bounded_prism_discretization.M`. It is exactly
`exists_bounded_prism_discretization.M 3 = 3⁴ + 3³ + 3 + 1 = 112`, the exponent in the number
of prisms in the discretization of a ball at scale `δ'` supplied by
`Kakeya.exists_finite_test_family_maxDensity_closedBall`.

An extra `+1` would absorb the per-prism count
`Δ_max(𝒫)|K|/|P| ≲ Δ_max(𝒫)` under the assumption `Δ_max(𝒫) ≤ (δ')⁻¹`. That assumption is not
available: the only density bound the configuration supplies is (C4)'s
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering`, `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ≤ C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}`, and its
constant `C_bias` is itself allowed to depend on `δ`, so converting it into `(δ')⁻¹` is not a
fixed-scale threshold. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard` therefore carries the density bound as
an explicit factor `Δ` instead, and the exponent below counts only the cover.

The blueprint writes `(δ')^{-3}`, which is what one gets from an *optimal* discretization of
the unit ball by `a' × b' × 1` planks. The discretization actually available in this
development is much more wasteful, and the honest exponent is the one below; nothing
downstream cares, because `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` takes the exponent
as an arbitrary real `N` in its hypothesis `hcard`.

**Why it lives here.** The eleventh clause
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverseFill_threshold` of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`
names the cardinality data at which the plank-to-slab reduction is invoked, so this exponent
has to sit upstream of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, exactly as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureConstant` does for the tenth clause. -/

/-- **The ball-filling half of the plank-to-slab reduction, available at the scale `δ`**
(blueprint `def:ml2transverseFillThreshold` together with Items 1 and 5 of
`lemmaredplanktubeAtTypicalAngle`).

This is the fragment of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` that the transverse
branch consumes — the refinement `(𝒫', Y')`, Item 1 (the almost-filling of a `θ b`-ball) and
Item 5 (the sub-polynomial bound on its constant) — read at the exponents at which the branch
invokes the reduction, `ε = η/256` and `ε' = η/2`, and *at one fixed scale* `δ`.

Isolating it as a predicate is what turns the eleventh clause of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`
into an informative hypothesis. `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` produces its
smallness threshold `δ_*` existentially, after the exponents and the cardinality data
`(Ccard, D)` and before the scale; that threshold can therefore not be *named* in a structure
declared upstream of the reduction's call site, and the clause `cfg.δ ≤ thr.fill` an earlier
version carried said nothing at all, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds.fill` having no
defining property. Asserting the *conclusion* at the scale in question says exactly what the
by-choice threshold was meant to say, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isReductionFillAvailable`
certifies that it does hold below a threshold fixed before the scale, so the clause is neither
vacuous nor unsatisfiable.

Only the items the branch reads are carried. Items 2, 3 and 4, the representative and slab
data and the five hoisted geometric constants play no part in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill`, and including them would make the clause harder to
arrange without making it more useful.

The refinement is carried twice: `(𝒫', Y')` refines `(𝒫, Y)` and it also refines `(𝒫, Y'')`,
mirroring the corresponding pair of clauses of
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle`.

The nonemptiness of `U(𝒫', Y')` is carried as well. Item 1 of the reduction fires only at a
point where `U(𝒫', Y')` meets a `θ b`-ball, and the two refinement clauses give no lower
bound on the output family (a refinement may drop every index), so without this clause
`s' = ∅` would satisfy the predicate vacuously and the guard in Item 1 could never be
discharged. It is a consequence of the fullness of the output, `(c_Lam · a^ε) λ(𝒫, Y) ≤
λ(𝒫', Y')`, together with the positivity of `λ(𝒫, Y)`, both of which the full reduction
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` supplies; recording it here is what lets the
consumer fire Item 1. -/
