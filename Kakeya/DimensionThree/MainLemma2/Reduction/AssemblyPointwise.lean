# `GWZ Lemma 9.1 ⟹ GWZ Main Lemma 2` — the *pointwise* assembly

`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_frostmanEstimate_of_lemma91`
(`Reduction/Assembly.lean`) derives the protected Main Lemma 2 from **three** hypotheses:

1. `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform`, the `β`-uniform *strengthening* of the protected GWZ
   Lemma 9.1;
2. `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCore`, stated over a window `[β₀,1]`;
3. the small-cardinality case `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.SmallCard`.

This module derives the same conclusion from **two**, dropping (1) outright and keeping (3)
*definitionally unchanged* (`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.SmallCardHyp` below is the third binder of the
three-hypothesis assembly, copied verbatim; the `example` immediately after it feeds that very
binder and so is the compiler's own proof that the two slots have the same type).

## Why (1) can go, and why it cannot go alone

`Kakeya.VNSUniform.mainLemma2Statement_of_pointwise_drop` manufactures the `MonotoneOn ν` clause
of Main Lemma 2 out of `Kakeya.VNSUniform.estimateSet_shape` — the estimate set
`A = {β ∈ (0,1] | K_KT β ∧ K_F β}` is a nonempty up-set containing its own infimum — so only a
*pointwise* drop is needed and no uniformity in `β` is required anywhere.  That is what makes (1)
removable; `Kakeya.VNSUniform.no_monotoneOn_drop_of_open_threshold` shows in the other direction
that uniformity of Lemma 9.1 could never have been the whole story, since in the one shape of `A`
that `estimateSet_shape` excludes the protected conclusion is outright false.

Removing (1) **alone** buys nothing, and this is the load-bearing point.  The field
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Params.body` reads

  `∀ ζ, 0 < ζ → ∀ β ∈ Set.Icc β₀ 1, VNSBody β ϖ ζ (gain ζ) (dens ζ)`,

so even instantiated at `β₀ = β` it still demands the whole window `[β,1]`.  Hence
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCore` as written cannot be fed by the non-uniform, protected Lemma
9.1, and plugging it into the pointwise reduction removes no obligation.  The window has to come
out of the geometric interface as well, which is what `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91ParamsAt`,
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCoreAt` and `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.PointwiseCore` are for.  Restating
that interface is free: `GeometricCore` has no producer anywhere in the tree.

## Nothing is relocated into a harder place

`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.pointwiseCore_of_lemma91Uniform_of_geometricCore` proves

  `Lemma91Uniform → GeometricCore → PointwiseCore`,

i.e. the single new obligation is *implied by the pair it replaces*.  The difficulty is therefore
weakened, not moved.  In the other direction `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91ParamsAt` proves
that the per-exponent parameter package is available with **no hypothesis at all**: it is
Skolemised out of the protected `Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge`, consumed here
as a *term*.  So a producer of `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCoreAt` really is handed GWZ Lemma
9.1's data at the exponent it is working at, and
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.pointwiseCore_of_geometricCoreAt` converts that into `PointwiseCore` for free.

## What is *not* changed

* the protected Main Lemma 2 statement: the conclusion below is `∃ ν, …` written out, and it is
  pinned to `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_frostmanEstimate` by the tripwires in
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2Ptw.lean` (this module cannot carry them itself, because
  `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2` still routes through the abandoned Wang--Zahl subtree and
  `Reduction/` must stay clear of it);
* the small-cardinality hypothesis, which is `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.SmallCardHyp`, definitionally the
  third binder of the three-hypothesis assembly;
* the substance of the geometric core — GWZ Lemma 7.7(B), Theorem 7.3(B), the two-scale split, the
  rescaling and the eccentric/non-eccentric analysis are untouched;
* GWZ Lemma 9.1's own open leaf (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData`).

## The prose obstruction in `Reduction/Assembly.lean` is refuted here, in the kernel

The docstring of `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform` argues that per-`β` drops "never assemble
into a uniform one by pure analysis".  They do:
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.katzTaoDropSet_nonempty_of_pointwiseDrop` derives that docstring's own
predicate, `Kakeya.ML2Reduction.katzTaoDropSet β₀ ≠ ∅` for every `β₀ ∈ (0,1]`, from the pointwise
drop alone.  The prose counts what `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.mono` does to the *hypotheses* of a drop
and omits what it does to the *conclusion*: a drop at `b` serves every exponent `≥ b` at the full
drop, so the induced cover of `[β₀,1]` is by right rays, not by left neighbourhoods, and one ray
suffices.  Consequently `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_pointwiseCore_via_envelope`
reaches the protected statement through `Reduction/Envelope.lean` as well, from the same two
hypotheses: deleting `Lemma91Uniform` strands neither route.

## Additivity

Nothing in `Reduction/Assembly.lean` is edited or removed by this module.  With it in place the
following become unreachable from the two-hypothesis route and are candidates for deletion once
the wider Section-9 sequencing allows:
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform`, `Lemma91Params`, `exists_lemma91Params`,
`lemma91_of_lemma91Uniform`, `isSpine_mono_beta`, and Part 1 of
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/VeryNotStickyUniform.lean` (with it the
`UniformPlankExponent` / `@[irreducible] Classical.choose plankFrostmanExponent` blocker).

/-! ## GWZ Lemma 9.1 as a term -/

/-- **GWZ Lemma 9.1, as a term rather than a hypothesis.**

`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91` is the conclusion of the protected
`Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge` with every binder written out, and
`Reduction/Assembly.lean` already pins the two together with an anonymous `example`.  That
`example` cannot be applied, so the assembly could not consume it; this is the same fact as a
named theorem, and it is what lets the pointwise route use Lemma 9.1 without assuming it.

It is also the **one line to edit** if Lemma 9.1 is strengthened.  Strengthening is permitted —
extra conclusion clauses may be added when a consumer provably needs them — and it changes the
shape of the existential, breaking any `obtain` pattern written against it.  Routing the pointwise
reduction through this single term confines that breakage here. -/

/-! ## The parameters of Lemma 9.1 at a single exponent -/

/-- The parameter package of GWZ Lemma 9.1 **at one exponent `β`**: the window exponent `ϖ` and
the two exponent *functions* `gain = ν(β,·)`, `dens = η(β,·)` that `Kakeya.ML2Spine.IsSpine` is
stated against.

This is `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Params` with the window `Set.Icc β₀ 1` of its `body` field
collapsed to the single point `β` — see
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.lemma91ParamsAt_of_lemma91Params`, which shows that no information is lost by
pointwise-ing the interface: the uniform package is exactly this one, held at every `β` of its
window. -/
structure Lemma91ParamsAt (β ϖ : ℝ) (gain dens : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop where
  /-- The window exponent is positive. -/

  /-- The gain function is positive on positive tolerances. -/
  gain_pos : ∀ ζ : ℝ, 0 < ζ → 0 < gain ζ
  /-- The density function is positive on positive tolerances. -/
  dens_pos : ∀ ζ : ℝ, 0 < ζ → 0 < dens ζ
  /-- **The centring margin** (GWZ proof  `q = min{a₀/10, ν₀/100, ε_out/100}` and 
  `4q ≤ η₀`): the density exponent leaves room for four times the preparation exponent
  `q = gain ζ / 100`.  It is what lets the reduction hand Lemma 9.1 a *centred* family: the
  canonical cover's fibre is bounded by `Δ_max` ( with ), so the centring's
  multiplicity loss and the density it consumes are the same exponent, and the site can only supply
  it by reading `Lemma91At` at `ηd := q + cst` (`Kakeya.ML2Reduction.Lemma91At.mono_dens`).  It is
  **not** a property of Lemma 9.1 — the gain is shrunk to arrange it, at no cost, in
  `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91ParamsAt`. -/

/-- **The parameters of GWZ Lemma 9.1, packaged as functions — with no hypothesis.**

Skolemisation of the protected `Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge` at one exponent,
routed through `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.lemma91`.  Unlike `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91Params`,
which needs the assumed `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform`, this theorem assumes nothing: Lemma
9.1 is consumed as a term, so every consumer of `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91ParamsAt` is consuming
GWZ Lemma 9.1 itself. -/

/-! ## The geometric core, restated pointwise -/

/-- **The geometric core of the GWZ reduction, at one exponent.**

`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCore` with the window `[β₀,1]` collapsed to the single exponent `β`:
the Katz--Tao exponent `ε₁` of Theorem 7.3(B) and the density exponent `η` may be chosen *after*
`β`, and the input package is the per-exponent `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91ParamsAt`, which the
**protected**, non-uniform Lemma 9.1 supplies (`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91ParamsAt`).

Everything else is as in `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCore`: the drop is
`Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineNu β ϖ ε₁ gain dens`, which has **no `ε` argument**, Theorem 7.3(B) is read
at the absolute accuracy `Kakeya.ML2Spine.absAccuracy β = β/2`, and the gain asked of the window
branch is `4` times the drop, the `4` being the exponent of the crude cardinality bound
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.card_le_rpow_neg_four`.

The two hypotheses `K_KT β` and `K_F β` are in the statement because every geometric input of the
chain consumes them; they are exactly what is available at the point of use. -/
def GeometricCoreAt : Prop :=
  ∀ (β ϖ : ℝ) (gain dens : ℝ → ℝ), 0 < β → β ≤ 1 → Lemma91ParamsAt.{u} β ϖ gain dens →
    KatzTaoEstimate.{u} (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) β →
    FrostmanEstimate.{u} (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) β →
    ∃ ε₁ : ℝ, 0 < ε₁ ∧ ∃ η : ℝ, 0 < η ∧ η ≤ 1 ∧
      Dichotomy.{u} β (β / 2) (4 * ML2Spine.spineNu β ϖ ε₁ gain dens) η

/-- **The single geometric obligation of the pointwise route.**

At every exponent `β ∈ (0,1]` where both partial estimates hold, produce an `ε`-free drop `c > 0`
inside the budget `2c ≤ β`, together with a density exponent `η` for which the GWZ dichotomy
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Dichotomy` holds at absolute accuracy `β/2` and gain `4c`.

This is deliberately *not* parameterised by Lemma 9.1's exponents: a producer may obtain them for
itself, with no hypothesis, from `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91ParamsAt`, and
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.pointwiseCore_of_geometricCoreAt` is that route.  Stating the obligation this
way is what makes it *implied by the pair it replaces*
(`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.pointwiseCore_of_lemma91Uniform_of_geometricCore`).

There is no `ε` binder here, and none in `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Dichotomy`, so the drop is still
chosen before the accuracy, per Prof. Hong Wang's clarification of 2026-08-30;
`Kakeya.ML2Spine.not_epsFree_of_outerAccuracy` refutes the alternative reading. -/
def PointwiseCore : Prop :=
  ∀ β : ℝ, 0 < β → β ≤ 1 →

      Dichotomy.{u} β (β / 2) (4 * c) η

/-- **The `β`-parameterised pointwise core gives the abstract one**, with GWZ Lemma 9.1 supplying
the parameter package as a term and `Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineNu` supplying the drop.  The two budgets
`0 < c` and `2c ≤ β` are `Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineNu_pos` and `Kakeya.ML2Spine.two_spineNu_le`. -/

/-- **The new obligation is implied by the two it replaces.**

`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform` together with the windowed
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.GeometricCore` produce `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.PointwiseCore`.  So dropping the
uniform companion and pointwise-ing the geometric interface is a **weakening** of the residue, not
a trade: no difficulty is relocated into a deeper or harder place.

The window is collapsed by instantiating the old core at `β₀ = β`, where `Set.Icc β 1` contains
`β` by `le_rfl`. -/

/-! ## The small-cardinality hypothesis, unchanged -/

/-- **The third binder of `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_frostmanEstimate_of_lemma91`,
copied verbatim.**

Naming it changes nothing: the `example` immediately below feeds a term of this type into that
very binder of the three-hypothesis assembly, so the compiler certifies that the pointwise route
asks for the small-cardinality case at exactly the same strength — not a stronger stand-in, and
not a weaker one either. -/

    ∀ γ : ℝ, β / 2 ≤ γ → γ < β → SmallCard.{u} γ

/-- **Fidelity compatibility for the small-cardinality hypothesis.**  If
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.SmallCardHyp` ever drifts from the third binder of the three-hypothesis
assembly, this stops compiling. -/

/-! ## The old envelope interface, discharged from the same two hypotheses -/

/-- **The pointwise drop**, as a named `Prop`: at every exponent where both partial estimates
hold, *some* positive drop is available.  Nothing here is uniform in `β` — neither the drop nor any
of Lemma 9.1's exponents — and this is exactly the hypothesis of
`Kakeya.VNSUniform.mainLemma2Statement_of_pointwise_drop`, named so that it can be quantified over
and fed to more than one consumer. -/

    ∃ d : ℝ, 0 < d ∧ KatzTaoEstimate.{u} (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) (β - d)

/-- **The two hypotheses of this module produce the pointwise drop.**

One application of `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_dichotomy` at the exponent in hand:
the geometric obligation supplies the drop `c`, the budget `2c ≤ β` and the dichotomy at gain `4c`,
and the small-cardinality hypothesis supplies its other branch at `γ = β - c`, which is in
`[β/2, β)` because `0 < c` and `2c ≤ β`. -/

/-! ## The assembly, from two hypotheses -/

/-- **GWZ Lemma 9.1 ⟹ GWZ Main Lemma 2, from two hypotheses.**

The conclusion is, verbatim, the statement of the protected
`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.katzTaoEstimate_sub_of_frostmanEstimate`; the tripwires that pin it to the
protected declaration are in `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2Ptw.lean`.  GWZ Lemma 9.1 is **not**
a hypothesis here: it is consumed as a term wherever it is needed
(`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.exists_lemma91ParamsAt`, reached through
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.pointwiseCore_of_geometricCoreAt`).

The two hypotheses are

* `hcore`, the single geometric obligation `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.PointwiseCore`;
* `hsmall`, the small-cardinality case `Kakeya.ML2Assembly.SmallCardHyp`, definitionally the same
  binder the three-hypothesis assembly takes.

The `MonotoneOn ν` clause — the sole reason the three-hypothesis assembly needed
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Lemma91Uniform` — is discharged by
`Kakeya.VNSUniform.mainLemma2Statement_of_pointwise_drop`, i.e. by
`Kakeya.VNSUniform.estimateSet_shape`, and not by any uniformity of Lemma 9.1. -/

the two assemblies, and it is the check that the reduction from three obligations to two is a
