# The abstract defect descent 

GWZ run its Main-Lemma-2 argument as a **loop**, not as a single shot.  One
*trial* (`lem:defect-one-trial`,  of
GWZ) consumes a shaded family and
returns one of two alternatives,

* `(G)`  a terminal bound `μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ Λ δ^{-ω} δ^{ν₀} (#𝕊)^β`, or
* `(B)`  a nonempty subfamily `𝕊* ⊆ 𝕊` with a sub-shading `Z*` such that
  `μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ Λ μ(𝕊*,Z*)`, `λ(𝕊*,Z*) ≥ Λ⁻¹ λ(𝕊,Z)` and `Φ_h(𝕊*) ≤ Φ_h(𝕊) − 1`,

and the outer induction runs on the ceiling `P = 0,…,P_max` of the potential:

```
 Φ_h(𝕊) ≤ P  and  λ(𝕊,Z) ≥ Λ^{P−P_max} δ^{η₀}
   ⟹  μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ Λ^{P+1} δ^{-ω} δ^{ν₀} (#𝕊)^β.
```

This file is that induction and **nothing else**: the potential `Φ`, its ceiling `P`, the loss
`Λ`, the fullness `lam`, the mass `μ` and the two terminal right-hand sides `A`, `B` are all
*parameters*.  No tube, no cover, no shading occurs anywhere in the statements, so the file
compiles against `Kakeya.Mathlib.ENNReal` alone and is independent of the geometric potential of
`Kakeya.ML2Core.potential` (`SpineDefectPotential.lean`) — which is the point: the descent may be
checked before the potential exists, and the potential may be replaced without touching the
descent.

Two terminal right-hand sides rather than one, because the tree's
`Kakeya.ML2Assembly.Dichotomy` is a disjunction: `A` carries the sticky exit
`δ^{-ε₀}·vol(⋃)` and `B` the gain exit `δ^{g}·(#𝕊)^{β}·vol(⋃)`.  Both must be **monotone along
the descent** (`A y ≤ A x`), which they are: `𝕊* ⊆ 𝕊` and `Z*(T) ⊆ Z(T)` shrink both the
cardinality and the volume of the union.

## The fullness ladder, and why it is stated multiplicatively

The source writes the induction hypothesis as `λ ≥ Λ^{P−P_max} δ^{η₀}` with a *negative* power of
`Λ`.  In `ℝ≥0∞` that is `lam0 ≤ Λ^(P − Φ x) * lam x` with truncated subtraction and no division,
which is the form used here.  A descent step consumes exactly one power: from
`lam x ≤ Λ * lam y` and `Φ y + 1 ≤ Φ x` one gets the ladder at `y`, because
`P − Φ y ≥ (P − Φ x) + 1`.

## Contents

* `Kakeya.ML2Core.gain_of_trialDescent` — the strong induction on `Φ`;
* `Kakeya.ML2Core.gain_of_trialDescent_top` — its top-level form, with the accumulated factor
  flattened to `Λ ^ P`;
* `Kakeya.ML2Core.gain_of_trialDescent_single` — the degenerate case `Φ ≡ 0`, which is the
  existing single-shot route (compatibility `T-D3`).

/-- **The abstract defect descent** (GWZ).

`htrial` is one trial: on an admissible state whose fullness is on the ladder, either a terminal
bound holds (`μ x ≤ A x` or `μ x ≤ B x`), or there is a *child* `y` — admissible, of strictly
smaller potential — paying one factor `Λ` in the mass and one in the fullness, and not increasing
either terminal right-hand side.

The conclusion accumulates exactly `Λ ^ Φ x`, so the ceiling `P` is spent only through the
ladder.  Note that no separate base case is assumed: at `Φ x = 0` the alternative `(B)` is
*unavailable* because `Φ y + 1 ≤ 0` is impossible in `ℕ`, which is the source's "(B) is impossible
at `P = 0`". -/

/-- **The descent, read at the top of the ladder.**

At the top the fullness hypothesis is the plain floor `lam0 ≤ lam x` (the source's
`λ(𝕋,Y) ≥ δ^{η₀}`) and the accumulated factor is flattened to `Λ ^ P`, which is the
`Λ^{P_max+1} ≤ δ^{-a₀}` the loop's ledger absorbs. -/
