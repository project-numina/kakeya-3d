# `SRC-A`: the lower fullness, recovered on `(𝕊'', Z'')` — the family FULLDROP dispersed it off

 §SRC-A: source  requires the count floor, the **lower fullness** and the
two-level density statements to hold for the **same** family `(𝕊'', Z'')`.  the estimate `FULLDROP` removed
the fullness clause from `Kakeya.ML2Core.RefinedFloorHypothesis`, on the recorded ground that the
rate "lives in the trial's hereditary rows" — naming
`Kakeya.ML2Core.fullness_refinement_of_denseShading`, which concludes fullness of `S'` **with
respect to `Z`**, the *ambient* shading.  The deleted clause was with respect to **`W`**, the
*refined* one, and `Kakeya.ShadedBody.fullness_mono_shade` bounds
`fullness S' W ≤ fullness S' Z` — the **wrong side**.  (The tree states the principle against itself
at `Plank/EDWeightedExtraction.lean`: *"fullness is not monotone under restriction"*.)

**The repair is available, and it does not touch `FULLDROP`.**  Clause 5 of
`Kakeya.ML2Core.IsShadedRefinementOf` is the source's own mass retention,
`∑_{𝕊'}|Z| ≤ Λ ∑_{𝕊''}|Z''|`, and it *does* bound the refined fullness from below, at the cost of
one `Λ`:

> `Kakeya.ML2Core.IsShadedRefinementOf.fullness'_le` —
> `fullness' S Z ≤ Λ * fullness' S' W`.

The proof is three moves and no side conditions: the refinement's tubes are the ambient ones, so the
denominators satisfy `∑_{S'} |W_i| = ∑_{S'} |Z_i| ≤ ∑_S |Z_i|`; shrinking a denominator raises the
quotient; and clause 5 raises the numerator.

## The family/shading column, stated for every row of this file

| row | family | shading |
|---|---|---|
| `IsShadedRefinementOf` clause 5 (source ) | `S` numerator, `S'` denominator | `Z` on `S`, `W` on `S'` |
| `fullness' S Z` | `S` = `𝕊'` | `Z` — the **ambient** shading |
| `fullness' S' W` | `S'` = `𝕊''` | `W` = `Z''` — the **refined** shading |
| `fullness_refinement_of_denseShading` (the FULLDROP ground) | `S'` = `𝕊''` | **`Z`**, not `W` — this is the defect |
| `IsShadedRefinementOf.le_mul_fullness'_of_trial` (below) | `S'` = `𝕊''` | **`W`** = `Z''` — the deleted clause, on the right family *and* the right shading |

`Kakeya.ML2Core.IsShadedRefinementOf.le_mul_fullness'_of_trial` delivers
`δ^{ηin}/2 ≤ Λ · fullness' S' W` from the trial's own hereditary rows
(`ML2Shaded.HasDenseShading lam S Z` and `δ^{ηin}/2 ≤ lam`) — i.e. `FULLDROP`'s recorded ground is
**correct after all**, but only through this lemma and only up to the factor `Λ`, and neither was
on record.  What was missing is not the rate but the transport of the rate **across the shading**.

Only clause 3 (same tubes) and clause 5 (the source's mass retention) of
