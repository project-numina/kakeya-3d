# The parameter spine of the proof of GWZ Main Lemma 2

This module carries the *parameter-selection step* of the blueprint proof of Main Lemma 2
(GWZ: the block "Proof of Main Lemma~\ref{lemmain2}"), and
nothing else: every declaration below is a statement about real numbers and natural numbers.
There is no tube, no shading, no plank and no measure.

## What the blueprint asks for

Fix `β ∈ (0, 1]`.  The proof names, in dependency order,

* `ε₁`, the Katz--Tao exponent produced by Theorem 7.3(B)
  (`katzTaoAtEveryScaleImpliesMultSmall`) at some accuracy;
* `ϖ = ϖ(β) > 0`, the scale-window exponent of Lemma 9.1 (`lemmain2vns`, in Lean
  `Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge`), together with the two exponents
  `ν(β, ζ) > 0` and `η(β, ζ) > 0` that Lemma 9.1 produces at each `ζ > 0`;
* `ε₂ = ε₂(ε₁, ϖ, β)`, subject to `ε₂ ≤ ε₁/5` and `ε₂ ≤ ϖ/2`;
* `N = ⌈25/ε₂²⌉` and the dividing-scales exponent `e = 1/√N` of Lemma
  `dividingScalesLemmaB` (GWZ: which *sets* `ε = 1/√N`).  The Lean form of that
  lemma, `StickyKakeya.dividingScalesKatzTao`, additionally demands `4096 ≤ N`; see
  the section "The `4096` threshold" below;
* a chain `η = η₀ ≤ η₁ ≤ … ≤ η_N ≤ e`, each rung "very small depending on `η_{j+1}`, `ε₂`
  and `β`";
* the gain `ν` of Main Lemma 2 itself, "selected small compared to `η₁`".

The constraints the proof imposes on the chain, collected from the text, are

1. `ε₂ ≤ ε₁/5` — so that conclusion (i) of the dividing-scales lemma is `δ^{-ε₁}` Katz--Tao at
   every scale and Theorem 7.3(B) applies;
2. `ε₂ ≤ ϖ/2` — so that after rescaling `T_b` to `B₁` the window `[(δ')^{1-ϖ}, (δ')^{ϖ}]` of
   Lemma 9.1 sits inside the window `[δ̃^{1-ε₂}, δ̃^{ε₂}]` on which the count bound is known.
   The arithmetic content of that inclusion is `ε₂ (1 + ϖ) ≤ ϖ`, which is the field
   `IsSpine.window_fits`;
3. with `η'_{j-1} := 12 η_{j-1}/(e β)` (the blueprint's eccentricity threshold, written there
   with `ε₂` in the denominator; see the note on denominators below), the separation
   `η'_{j-1} ≤ e η_j / 4`.  The blueprint asks only `η'_{j-1} ≤ η_j ε₂`, which is what forces
   `b ≥ δ̃^{ε₂}` by contradiction with `Δ_max(𝕋̃_ρ) ≥ ρ^{-η_j}`; the sharper `/4` is what the
   count hypothesis of Lemma 9.1 needs, since `δ̃^{2 η'_{j-1}} ≥ σ^{η_j/2}` for
   `σ ≤ δ̃^{e}` requires `2 η'_{j-1} ≤ e η_j / 2`;
4. the eccentric case is pure exponent arithmetic and imposes *no* constraint: by the very
   definition of `η'_{j-1}`,
   `-2 η_{j-1}/e + β η'_{j-1} = 10 η_{j-1}/e`, which is `IsSpine.eccentric_exponent`;
5. `ν(β, η_j/2) - 2 η'_{j-1} ≥ 10 η_{j-1}/e` in the non-eccentric case
   (`IsSpine.gain_budget`);
6. `η_{j-1}/e ≤ η(β, η_j/2)/2`, which is what makes `Δ_max(𝕋̃[T_b]) ≤ δ̃^{-η'}` hold for the
   density exponent `η'` of Lemma 9.1 at `ζ = η_j/2`, with room to spare for the passage from
   `δ̃` to `δ' = δ̃/b ≤ δ̃^{1-ε₂}` (`IsSpine.dens_budget`);
7. `ν ≤ η₁`;
8. `4096 ≤ N` (`IsSpine.four_thousand_le_stepCount`), which is not in the blueprint text but is
   a hypothesis of the Lean statement of the dividing-scales lemma — see the next section.

## The `4096` threshold

`StickyKakeya.dividingScalesKatzTao`, this development's GWZ Lemma 7.7(B), carries the
hypothesis `hN : 4096 ≤ N`.  The blueprint hides that constant inside "let `N` be large
enough", but in Lean it is a real side condition, and a spine that cannot supply it cannot be
fed to the dichotomy at all: `stepCount_eq` together with a cap `ε₂ ≤ 1/2` yields only
`N = ⌈25/ε₂²⌉ ≥ 100`.  So `4096 ≤ N` is a field of `IsSpine`, and the witness `spineEps₂` is
capped at `1/64` rather than `1/2`, which gives `N ≥ 25 · 64² = 102400`
(`Kakeya.ML2Spine.hundredThousand_le_spineCount`).  Tightening the cap costs nothing: `ε₂` is
free to be as small as one likes, every constraint on it is an upper bound, and the derived
quantities only improve (`e = 1/√N ≤ ε₂/5 ≤ 1/320`).

## `ε₂` versus `e = 1/√N`: a repair, not a change of numerals

The blueprint writes `ε₂` in the denominator of every exponent of the middle scale, and also
writes `δ̃ ≤ δ^{ε₂}`.  Those two are not simultaneously available: Lemma
`dividingScalesLemmaB` is applied with *its* exponent `ε = 1/√N`, and what it returns is
`τ ≤ δ^{1/√N} θ`, i.e. `δ̃ ≤ δ^{e}` with `e = 1/√N ≤ ε₂/5`, which is *weaker* than
`δ̃ ≤ δ^{ε₂}`.  Since `e ≤ ε₂`, replacing `ε₂` by `e` in every denominator makes each
constraint strictly *harder*, and the resulting parameters therefore satisfy the blueprint's
`ε₂`-form as well.  Both forms are recorded: the fields of `IsSpine` are stated with `e`, and
`IsSpine.sep_eps₂`, `IsSpine.gain_budget_eps₂`, `IsSpine.dens_budget_eps₂` derive the
`ε₂`-form from them.  Likewise the window of the dividing-scales lemma is
`[δ̃^{1-e}, δ̃^{e}] ⊇ [δ̃^{1-ε₂}, δ̃^{ε₂}]`, so a hypothesis known on the `ε₂`-window is known
on the `e`-window only in the easy direction; every clause below is stated so that the
consumer may use whichever of the two it holds.

## `ν` does not depend on `ε` (Prof. Hong Wang, 2026-08-30)

The published proof reads `ε₁` as the output of Theorem 7.3(B) *at the outer accuracy `ε`*,
which would make `ε₂`, `N`, the chain and `ν` all depend on `ε`; the parenthesis "since `ε₁`
and `ϖ` depend only on `β`, `ε₂` depends only on `β`" is then false, and the statement of Main
Lemma 2, whose `ν = ν(β)` is fixed before `ε`, cannot be reached.  The correction is that
Theorem 7.3(B) is applied at an **absolute** accuracy `ε₀`, here `Kakeya.ML2Spine.absAccuracy β
= β/2`, a function of `β` alone.

Two declarations make this a theorem rather than a comment.

* `Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineNu` is a definition whose argument list *does not contain `ε`*, and
  `Kakeya.ML2Spine.exists_ml2SpineParams` binds `ν` **outside** the `∀ ε > 0`.  The `∀ ε` is
  not idle: its body carries the closing inequality of the every-scale branch,
  `absAccuracy β ≤ ε + (β - ν)`, which is what turns the branch bound `μ ≤ δ^{-ε₀}` into the
  goal `μ ≤ δ^{-ε} |𝕋|^{β-ν}` in the presence of `|𝕋| ≥ δ^{-1}`.
* `Kakeya.ML2Spine.not_epsFree_of_outerAccuracy` shows the naive reading is *impossible*: if
  the spine is built from `E ε` rather than from `E ε₀`, and `E` takes arbitrarily small
  positive values — which it must, since a Katz--Tao exponent bounded below would give
  `μ ≲ δ^{-o(1)}` outright — then no positive `ν` can be chosen before `ε`.

## Shape of the chain

The chain is a bare `η : ℕ → ℝ` with a global `Monotone η`, not a `Fin (N+1) → ℝ`.  The
consumer receives the index `j` from `dividingScalesLemmaB` as a natural number with
`1 ≤ j ≤ N` and then uses `η (j-1)` and `η j`; with `Fin (N+1)` every one of those uses would
carry a coercion and a `j - 1 < N + 1` obligation, while the recursion that builds the chain
would have to be written on `Fin`.  Extending the chain to all of `ℕ` by the constant value
`e` above the top rung costs nothing — the budget fields are guarded by `k < N` — and buys a
single unconditional `Monotone η`, from which `η i ≤ η j` for any `i ≤ j` and `η k ≤ e` for
*every* `k` follow with no arithmetic side conditions.

/-! ### The specification -/

/-- **The parameter spine of the proof of Main Lemma 2.**

`IsSpine β ϖ ε₁ gain dens ε₂ e N η` says that `(ε₂, e, N, η)` satisfies every constraint the
blueprint proof of Main Lemma 2 imposes, given

* the exponent `β ∈ (0,1]` of the hypotheses `K_KT(β)`, `K_F(β)`;
* the scale-window exponent `ϖ = ϖ(β)` of Lemma 9.1;
* the Katz--Tao exponent `ε₁` of Theorem 7.3(B) — read at an **absolute** accuracy, see the
  module docstring;
* the two exponent functions `gain = ν(β, ·)` and `dens = η(β, ·)` of Lemma 9.1.

`e` is the dividing-scales exponent `1/√N` of `dividingScalesLemmaB`; it is a field rather
than a derived quantity because that lemma quantifies over `N` and *defines* its own `ε` to be
`1/√N`, so the consumer needs the two side by side. -/
structure IsSpine (β ϖ ε₁ : ℝ) (gain dens : ℝ → ℝ) (ε₂ e : ℝ) (N : ℕ) (η : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop where
  /-- `ε₂` is a positive exponent. -/
  eps₂_pos : 0 < ε₂
  /-- `ε₂ ≤ ε₁/5`: conclusion (i) of the dividing-scales lemma is then `δ^{-ε₁}` Katz--Tao at
  every scale, so Theorem 7.3(B) applies in the first branch. -/
  eps₂_le_everyScale : ε₂ ≤ ε₁ / 5
  /-- `ε₂ ≤ ϖ/2`: the rescaled count hypothesis lands inside the window
  `[(δ')^{1-ϖ}, (δ')^{ϖ}]` of Lemma 9.1. -/
  eps₂_le_vnsWindow : ε₂ ≤ ϖ / 2
  /-- `ε₂ ≤ 1/2`.  Kept in this weak form because that is all any consumer spends (it is used
  to turn `δ' ≤ δ̃^{1-ε₂}` into `δ' ≤ δ̃^{1/2}` in `dens_budget`, and to bound `e β ≤ 1`).  The
  sharp cap is a *consequence* of the two fields `stepCount_eq` and
  `four_thousand_le_stepCount` — see `Kakeya.ML2Spine.IsSpine.eps₂_lt_twelfth` — and the
  concrete witness `Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineEps₂` satisfies `ε₂ ≤ 1/64`. -/
  eps₂_le_half : ε₂ ≤ 1 / 2
  /-- The arithmetic content of the window inclusion of `eps₂_le_vnsWindow`: for
  `δ' = δ̃/b ≤ δ̃^{1-ε₂}` and `b ≥ δ̃^{ε₂}`, the image of `[(δ')^{1-ϖ}, (δ')^{ϖ}]` under
  `σ' ↦ σ' b` lies in `[δ̃^{1-ε₂}, δ̃^{ε₂}]` exactly when `ε₂ (1 + ϖ) ≤ ϖ`. -/
  window_fits : ε₂ * (1 + ϖ) ≤ ϖ
  /-- `N = ⌈25/ε₂²⌉`, the number of dividing scales. -/

  /-- `N ≥ 1`, as `dividingScalesLemmaB` demands. -/
  one_le_stepCount : 1 ≤ N
  /-- `N ≥ 4096`.

  This is the running threshold of the *Lean* form of the dividing-scales lemma:
  `StickyKakeya.dividingScalesKatzTao` (GWZ Lemma 7.7(B)) carries the hypothesis
  `hN : 4096 ≤ N`, and without this field no spine can be fed to it — `stepCount_eq`
  together with `eps₂_le_half` gives only `N = ⌈25/ε₂²⌉ ≥ 100`.  It is not an extra demand
  on the blueprint: `ε₂` is chosen "small enough" there, and `ε₂ ≤ 1/64` already forces
  `25/ε₂² ≥ 102400`.  The witness `Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineEps₂` is capped at `1/64` for
  exactly this reason. -/

  /-- `e` is positive. -/

  /-- The chain is nondecreasing.  Above the top rung it is constant, so this holds on all of
  `ℕ`. -/

  /-- The top rung is `e`: this is `η_N ≤ ε` of `dividingScalesLemmaB` at its sharpest. -/

  /-- **Separation.**  With `η'_{k} = 12 η_k/(e β)` the blueprint's eccentricity threshold,
  `η'_{k} ≤ e η_{k+1}/4`.  The weaker `η'_k ≤ e η_{k+1}` is what forces `b ≥ δ̃^{ε₂}`; the
  factor `4` is what the count hypothesis of Lemma 9.1 needs. -/
  sep_le : ∀ k < N, 12 * η k / (e * β) ≤ e * η (k + 1) / 4
  /-- **The gain budget of the non-eccentric case**: `ν(β, η_{k+1}/2) - 2 η'_k ≥ 10 η_k/e`. -/
  gain_budget : ∀ k < N, 10 * η k / e + 2 * (12 * η k / (e * β)) ≤ gain (η (k + 1) / 2)
  /-- **The density budget**: `Δ_max(𝕋̃[T_b]) ≤ δ̃^{-η_k/e}` must be at most `(δ')^{-η'}` for
  the density exponent `η' = η(β, η_{k+1}/2)` of Lemma 9.1, and `δ' ≤ δ̃^{1-ε₂}` with
  `ε₂ ≤ 1/2`, so `η_k/e ≤ η(β, η_{k+1}/2)/2` suffices. -/

/-! ### The construction -/

/-- `ε₂ = min (ε₁/5) (ϖ/2) (1/64)`, the largest choice the two blueprint constraints allow,
capped at `1/64` so that `N = ⌈25/ε₂²⌉ ≥ 25 · 64² = 102400 ≥ 4096`.

The cap used to be `1/2`, which gives only `N ≥ 100`.  That was not enough:
`StickyKakeya.dividingScalesKatzTao` (GWZ Lemma 7.7(B)) refuses to run below
`4096` stopping steps, so no spine could instantiate the dichotomy at all.  See the field
`Kakeya.ML2Spine.IsSpine.four_thousand_le_stepCount`.  Nothing else in the blueprint proof
constrains the cap from below — it is a free "choose `ε₂` small enough" — so tightening it
weakens no conclusion. -/

exactly the three budgets of `IsSpine`.

  saturated eccentric cap `η̄_{k+1} = e² η_{k+1}/64`: `β·(e² x/64)/16 = e² β x/1024`.  It
  also pays the separation `12 η_k/(e β) ≤ e η_{k+1}/4` — now with room to spare rather than with
  equality, since `12 (e² β x/1024)/(e β) = e x/85.33`;
* `e β · gain (x/2) / 34` pays the gain budget, since
  `10 β/34 + 24/34 ≤ 1` for `β ≤ 1`;
* `e · dens (x/2) / 2` pays the density budget, again with equality.

The first entry also makes the step a contraction (`e² β/1024 ≤ 1`), which is what gives the

/-! ### The headline: `ν` is fixed before `ε` -/

/-- **Parameter selection for the proof of GWZ Main Lemma 2.**

Given `β ∈ (0, 1]`, the `β`-only data of Lemma 9.1 (`ϖ`, and the two exponent functions
`gain = ν(β, ·)` and `dens = η(β, ·)`), and the exponent map `E` of Theorem 7.3(B)
(`accuracy ↦ Katz--Tao exponent`), there is a gain `ν > 0` such that for **every** accuracy
`ε > 0` the whole parameter spine exists with that same `ν`.

The quantifier order is the content: `ν` is bound outside `∀ ε > 0`.  Theorem 7.3(B) is read
at `absAccuracy β = β/2`, an absolute accuracy in the sense of Prof. Hong Wang's clarification
— it is a function of `β` alone and in particular is not the outer `ε`.  The last conjunct of
the body is the only clause that mentions `ε` at all, and it is what the every-scale branch
needs: the branch gives `μ(𝕋, Y) ≤ δ^{-ε₀}`, and `ε₀ ≤ ε + (β - ν)` turns this into
`μ(𝕋, Y) ≤ δ^{-ε} |𝕋|^{β-ν}` once `|𝕋| ≥ δ^{-1}`.

`Kakeya.ML2Spine.not_epsFree_of_outerAccuracy` shows this conclusion is *unavailable* if `E`
is read at the outer `ε` instead. -/

/-! ### The obstruction: reading Theorem 7.3(B) at the outer `ε` kills the gain -/

/-- **Reading Theorem 7.3(B) at the outer accuracy makes an `ε`-free gain impossible.**

Suppose one insists on the published dependency `ε ↦ ε₁ = E ε ↦ ε₂ ↦ (N, η) ↦ ν` while still
demanding a single `ν > 0` valid for every `ε`.  The chain of the spine gives
`ν ≤ η₁ ≤ e ≤ ε₂/5 ≤ E ε/25`, so `ν` is bounded by `E ε/25` for every `ε > 0`.  If `E` takes
arbitrarily small positive values — which it must, since a Katz--Tao exponent bounded below by
some `η♭ > 0` at every accuracy would say that any family which is `δ^{-η♭}` Katz--Tao at every
scale has multiplicity `δ^{-ε}` for *every* `ε`, i.e. multiplicity `δ^{-o(1)}` — then `ν ≤ 0`,
a contradiction.

This is exactly why Theorem 7.3(B) must be applied at an absolute accuracy: the typo in the
published proof is not cosmetic, it is the difference between a theorem and a falsehood. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity

`spineRung_isSpine` and `exists_ml2SpineParams` are conditional: they carry hypotheses on
`β`, `ϖ`, `gain`, `dens` and `E`.  A conditional theorem whose hypotheses are unsatisfiable
proves nothing, so the two certificates below discharge every one of those hypotheses at
concrete data (`β = ϖ = 1`, `gain = dens = E = id`), leaving an unconditional existential.

/-- **`IsSpine` is inhabited, with no hypotheses left standing.**  Concrete instance of
`Kakeya.ML2Spine.spineRung_isSpine`; in particular the `4096 ≤ N` field is satisfiable
alongside all the others. -/
theorem exists_isSpine_at_one :
    ∃ ε₂ e : ℝ, ∃ N : ℕ, ∃ η : ℕ → ℝ,
      IsSpine 1 1 1 (fun x => x) (fun x => x) ε₂ e N η :=
  ⟨_, _, _, _,

/-- **The obstruction `Kakeya.ML2Spine.not_epsFree_of_outerAccuracy` is not vacuous either.**

That theorem derives `False` from a *uniform* `ν` together with a spine at `ε₁ = E ε` for every
`ε`.  One could worry that it derives `False` merely because its `IsSpine` clause is
unsatisfiable — which would make it say nothing about the published proof.  It is not: at every
positive `ε₁` whatsoever, in particular at `ε₁ = E ε`, the spine exists and its first rung is
positive.  So the only thing `not_epsFree_of_outerAccuracy` rules out is the uniformity of `ν`,
which is exactly the defect Prof. Hong Wang's clarification identifies. -/

/-- **`exists_ml2SpineParams` is not vacuous.**  Its six hypotheses are simultaneously
satisfiable, so the `ν` it produces is a real number and not a consequence of `False`. -/
