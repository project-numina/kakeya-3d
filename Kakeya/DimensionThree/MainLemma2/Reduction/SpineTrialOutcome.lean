# The trial interface 

The defect route splits across two hands: one owns the twin window and the `(F)`/`(P)` terminal
derivation, the other owns the potential, the descent and the `(D)` exit.  They meet on exactly one
statement, and **neither owns it**: `Kakeya.ML2Core.TrialOutcomeAt`, the conclusion of one trial of
GWZ's `lem:defect-one-trial`, with alternative `(D)` folded in as the
potential-drop alternative.

```
 one trial of  (𝕊, Z)  produces one of
 (G₁)  μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ δ^{-β/2} · |⋃ Z|                                   the sticky / absolute exit
 (G₂)  μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ δ^{4ν} · (#𝕊)^β · |⋃ Z|                            the terminal gain
 (B)   ∃ ∅ ≠ 𝕊* ⊆ 𝕊, ∃ Z* ⊆ Z :  μ(𝕊,Z) ≤ Λ μ(𝕊*,Z*),
                                  λ(𝕊,Z)  ≤ Λ λ(𝕊*,Z*),
                                  Φ_h(𝕊*) + 1 ≤ Φ_h(𝕊),
                                  𝕊* is class-homogeneous on the SAME tower
```

`(B)` also hands back the retained pair's own shading level `lam'`, decayed by at most `Λ`: the
GWZ's `λ(𝕊*,Z*) ≥ Λ⁻¹ λ(𝕊,Z)`, which is what P2's fullness ladder carries across
the `P_max` trials.  `ML2Shaded.HasComparableDensities lam'⁻¹` is **not** listed: it
follows from the dense shading and `0 < lam'` by
`Kakeya.ML2Shaded.HasDenseShading.hasComparableDensities`.  The
*floor* `δ^{ηin}/2 ≤ lam` is **not** here either — it stays a binder of the producer and is
re-established at every step by the descent's own ladder (correction 2).

The `IsClassHomogeneousOn` conjunct is, and it is what closes the descent's
induction:
the trial may only be run on a family whose classes are two-sidedly banded
(`Kakeya.ML2Core.IsClassHomogeneousOn`, the hypothesis of `Kakeya.ML2Core.IsTrialAt`), and `(B)`
hands back exactly that band on the family it retains.  The source pays for it with the trial's own
vector-valued dyadic selection at a single loss `Λ₀ ≤ Λ`: **a loss, not a constant**
(`Kakeya.ML2Core.not_reentry_le` is what a constant would cost).

## The three interface conditions, and where each is discharged by the text below

* **I-1 (condition `C-D1`).**  `𝒰` and `Cu` are **parameters**, not existentials.  The descent runs
  on **one** hierarchy for the whole loop and only the index set `S ⊆ u` varies.  This is not a
  convenience: every `GridUniform` restriction in the tree *squares* the uniformity constant
  (`Kakeya.MultiScaleFac.gridUniformBandConst`), so a trial that re-entered the uniformiser would
  accumulate `Cu ^ (2 ^ Pmax h δ)`, which no `δ`-free ceiling and no subpolynomial loss can absorb.  A producer that needs a fresh hierarchy is
  re-cutting this interface and must go back to the source comparison.
* **I-2 (the same family).**  `(B)` hands back a pair `(S', W)`, not a family and a separate
  shading: `W` refines `Z` tube-for-tube (`toTube` equal, `shade` contained), so `(G₁)`, `(G₂)` and
  the window clauses are all readable on the *same* pair at the next round.
* **I-3 (`h` and `Pmax` are named once).**  `Kakeya.ML2Core.potential` and
  `Kakeya.ML2Core.Pmax` live in `SpineDefectPotential.lean` and are *imported* here, so the two
  hands cannot each choose their own `h`.

## What is deliberately **not** in the statement

`TrialOutcomeAt` is the trial's **conclusion**, not the trial.  The admissibility binders — `S ⊆ u`,
the ball condition, the Katz–Tao bound at `ηin`, the fullness floor at `lam`, the block's
cardinality binder — belong to the *producer* `IsTrialAt` (`P7`), which is why `ηin` and `lam` do
not occur below.  Keeping them out is what lets the descent (`Kakeya.ML2Core.gain_of_trialDescent`)
consume this Prop without knowing how it was produced.
