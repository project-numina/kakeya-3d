# Section 6 compatibility interfaces used by Main Lemma 2

The current Section 6 API proves the angle-producing plank reduction in
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab`. Section 9 also needs two strictly stronger interfaces: a
typical-angle theorem whose comparison constant is controlled at an auxiliary scale, and a
plank reduction run at an already prescribed typical angle. They are retained here as the
accepted upstream obligations used by Main Lemma 2, without duplicating Section 6's implemented
declarations.

/-- **GWZ Lemma 6.13 at an already prescribed typical angle**, narrowed to the interface its
consumer reads.

This is the stronger interface required by the transverse branch of Main Lemma 2, and it is
intentionally separate from the implemented `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab`, which produces its
own angle. It remains an accepted Section 6 obligation.

## The 2026-08 narrowing, and why it is a narrowing and not a weakening

The full Lemma 6.13 tuple consists of the geometric constant
block `cN, cThk, Cbox, Cset, Cang`, and, per configuration, the fibre size `N`, the constants
`cP, cLam, c2, c3, c4`, the thickened representatives
`R : Plank.ThickenedRepr s' (ShadedPlank.planks Y) θ hθ1 cThk`, the slab assignment
`slabOf : Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b hθ1 hb1 → Slab θ hθ1` and the thickened shading
`Yθ : Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b hθ1 hb1 → ShadedBody _`, together with the cardinality retention,
`1 ≤ N`, the `Plank.inSlabFamilyC` membership clause, the `Yθ` carrier equation, the
representative fibre-cardinality clause, and Items 2, 3 and 4.

**Every one of those outputs was read by nothing.** This statement has exactly one consumer in the
development, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isReductionFillAvailable` in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankConstants`, and that consumer destructures the tuple and
discards all of them; the only components it forwards into
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsReductionFillAvailable` are `s'`, `Y'`, `c1`, the two `IsRefinement`
clauses, the nonemptiness of the output union (which it derives from the fullness retention and
the positivity of the input fullness), Item 1, and `c1⁻¹ ≤ δ ^ (-ε')`. So the deleted clauses were
carried through the whole obligation without ever being used.

**What deleting them buys is that `θ` disappears from every type in the statement.** In the old
form `θ` occurred in the *types* of the three witnesses `R`, `slabOf` and `Yθ` — a
`Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b hθ1 hb1` and a `Slab θ hθ1` are indexed by the angle — which is why
prescribing `θ` meant threading it, as a parameter rather than an output, through
`Kakeya.refinement_preassembly_uniform`, `Kakeya.PreassemblyResult` (where `θ` and `hθ1` are
produced *fields*, and `Plank.ThickenedRepr.repr_eq` pins each representative to be the
`θ`-thickening of a selected plank), `Kakeya.plankReduction` and
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab`. After the narrowing, `θ` occurs only in the *terms*
`θ * b` inside Item 1, and no type in the statement mentions it. The remaining obligation is
therefore a single local-density statement at a prescribed radius, not a reconstruction of the
stopping-time representative/slab apparatus at a prescribed angle.

The hypotheses are unchanged, `hθ1 : θ ≤ 1` included; it is now an ordinary hypothesis rather than
a binder occurring in the types of the deleted witnesses, and is retained because the consumer
supplies it and because dropping it would silently strengthen the statement.

## The state of the proof, and the exact remaining gap

With `θ` gone from the types, the prescribed-angle machinery this needs turns out to be **already
public**, and the obstruction is elsewhere.

* `Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform`
  (`Kakeya.DimensionThree.Plank.RepresentativeSelection`) is the representative/slab preassembly
  **at a prescribed angle**: it takes `(θ : ℝ≥0) (hθ1 : θ ≤ 1)` as inputs and returns `s'`, a
  refined shading, `repr`, `slabOf`, `𝒯`, `𝒮`, a `Plank.ThickenedRepr s' P θ hθ1 cThk`, the
  `Plank.inSlabFamilyC` membership, `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound s' _ P θ Cgeom`, the two-sided
  `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` at `θ`, the fibre-cardinality clause and the slab overlap.
* `Kakeya.slabwiseDensity_assigned` (`Kakeya.DimensionThree.Plank.SlabwiseReduction`) is Item 1
  **at a prescribed angle**: it is parametric in `{a b θ}` and in an arbitrary representative type,
  and from the slab membership, the max-angle bound at `θ`, the per-slab typicality, per-slab
  fullness and per-slab constant multiplicity it produces exactly the local-density conclusion
  above at radius `θ * b` and dilation `Kakeya.plankReduction.ballDilation = 3`.

So the remaining work is an assembly, not a new construction: it mirrors the Item 1 half of
`Kakeya.plankReduction` with `θ` taken from the caller instead of from the stopping time. Nothing
under `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/` has to be re-parametrised for that.

**What blocks it is a scale mismatch, not the angle.** Every hypothesis of those two producers is
stated at the *plank* scale `a`: `representativeWitness_strong_uniform` asks for
`Cuni⁻¹ * a ^ ε ≤ cAngle` on the incoming refinement coefficient and for
`a ^ η ≤ cLamY ≤ ShadedBody.fullness s Y`, and `slabwiseDensity_assigned` asks for per-slab
fullness `cLamPre * a ^ (η + εwork)` and per-slab constant multiplicity `Cmult * a ^ (-(εwork/4))`.
The data this statement receives are controlled only at the *auxiliary* scale `δ ≤ a`: the incoming
refinement coefficient is `C⁻¹ ≥ δ ^ ε`, the constant multiplicity is `C ≤ δ ^ (-ε)`, and the
multiplicity and cardinality hypotheses are read at `δ`. Since `δ` may be an arbitrarily high power
of `a`, `δ ^ ε · a ^ η` is not bounded below by any power of `a`, so the `a`-scale hypotheses are
not derivable from the `δ`-scale ones. That the statement is nevertheless the right one is visible
in its own exponent ledger: the conclusion asks for `c1` with `c1⁻¹ ≤ δ ^ (-ε')` and assumes
`128 * ε ≤ ε'`, of which this step needs one factor `δ ^ ε` for the passage to `Y''` and one for the
reduction itself — `δ`-scale bookkeeping throughout.

## Corrections to the paragraph above, established in `Section6CompatDense.lean` (2026-09)

The paragraph above is right that the obstruction is a scale mismatch and not the angle, but it
misidentifies *where* the mismatch is and *which* files have to change. Three corrections, all
checked against the actual declarations:

1. **`Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform` does not need re-parametrising for the
   refinement coefficient.** Its `a`-scale hypothesis is `Cuni⁻¹ * a ^ ε ≤ cAngle` with `Cuni`
   quantified *after* `cEta, Cres, kappa` and *before* the configuration, so instantiating
   `Cuni := C` turns it into `C⁻¹ * a ^ ε ≤ C⁻¹`, which is free. The `Cuni`-dependent outputs
   `cP, cLam, Cref` need not be used either: the theorem separately exposes `q = cGood / 2`,
   `rRef = (cGood - q) * cAngle`, `cEta * a ^ η ≤ cGood` and
   `rRef * λ(s, Y) ≤ λ(s', Y'')` with `cEta` independent of `Cuni`, giving
   `rRef ≥ (cEta / 2) * a ^ η * C⁻¹ ≥ (cEta / 2) * a ^ η * δ ^ ε` at a cost of exactly one
   `δ ^ ε`.
2. **What that witness *cannot* be given is its angular-stability hypothesis.** It asks for
   two-sided comparability on every subfibre retaining a `(Kakeya.plankReserveScale kappa a)⁻¹`
   fraction, i.e. at the **reserve** scale `kappa * plankAngleScaleA a ^ 2`. This statement hands
   it `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle … C (Real.toNNReal (Kakeya.plankAngleScaleA a))`, i.e. the
   *public* scale `plankAngleScaleA a`. Since `kappa ≥ 1` and `plankAngleScaleA a ≥ 1`, the
   reserve threshold is smaller, so strictly more subfibres are constrained: the reserve clause is
   strictly stronger, and `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.mono_scale` runs the other way. The reserve
   is exactly what the 6.13 proof spends (`Kakeya.stopScaleStability_of_fibreRetention` spends one
   factor of `Nov` out of it), so a prescribed-angle 6.13 has to *receive* it. The producer that
   would supply it exists and is already `δ`-parametric —
   `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_stable_reserve` is the (`private`)
   `findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_core` of
   `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/TypicalAngleIncidence.lean` specialised at `δ := a`, and
   `Kakeya.refineConst_bound_uniform_reserve_perScale` is the matching `perScale` refinement
   bound — but `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` publishes only the public-scale
   clause. **Adding the reserve-scale clause to that theorem's conclusion, and to this statement's
   hypotheses, is the interface repair this route needs.**
3. **`Kakeya.slabwiseDensity_assigned` is where the ledger actually breaks.** Its `c1` comes from
   `Kakeya.slabwiseDensity_of_outputs` as `c1 = cBall * cLamBox ^ 2` with
   `cLamBox = (2 * Cmult)⁻¹ * cLamPre / (512 * Nov * cTan)`, so per scale one must take
   `cLamPre ≈ δ ^ ε * cLamPre₀` and `Cmult ≈ δ ^ (-ε) * Cmult₀`, giving
   `c1 ∝ cLamPre ^ 2 / Cmult ^ 2 ≈ δ ^ (4ε)` before the `Nov`/`cTan` growth. Worse, that theorem's
   constant-multiplicity hypothesis is `Cmult * a ^ (-(εwork / 4))` with `εwork ≤ 4 * η / 11`
   fixed *before* the configuration, while the data here only bound `C ≤ δ ^ (-ε)` with `δ` an
   arbitrary power of `a`; and the dependence of `c1` on `Cθ`, `Cmult`, `cTan`, `Ceta`, `Nov` is
   nowhere quantified. So the `δ`-scale reparametrisation is a change to
   `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/SlabwiseReduction.lean` *and its whole dependency stack*, not to
   `RepresentativeSelection.lean`.

## The reduction that is existing, and the single obligation that remains

`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/Section6CompatDense.lean` proves
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle_of_denseRegion`: **this statement verbatim** — same
binders, same hypotheses, same `128 * ε ≤ ε'`, same conclusion — with exactly one hypothesis
inserted, namely that `U(s, Y'')` admits a measurable region `G` retaining a
`δ ^ (ε' - 2ε) * a ^ ε` fraction of it and such that `U(s, Y'') ∩ G` fills a `θ b`-ball around each
of its points to density `δ ^ ε' * a ^ (4η) * a ^ ε`. The witness for `δthr` is `1`: **no smallness
threshold is needed for the soft half**, and of `128 * ε ≤ ε'` this step spends `2 * ε` — one
`δ ^ ε` on the
incoming `C⁻¹`, one on the `C` that
`Plank.isCRefinement_restrictShade_of_dense` charges to convert a union capture into a mass
capture. `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle_of_avgDensity` is the same statement with
the obligation given instead as a finite `θ b`-ball cover whose sparse part is small.

The inserted hypothesis is GWZ Step 3 ("sum over the dense tangential pieces and discard the
complement; a final dense-ball selection preserves a substantial fraction of the shading mass"),
and it is the only non-soft content left.

## The smallest obligation currently available (2026-09, `Section6CompatThicken.lean`)

`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/Section6CompatThicken.lean` proves
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle_of_thickening`: **this statement verbatim** with
exactly one hypothesis inserted, and that hypothesis is a **scalar inequality** rather than an
existence statement about sets,

```
54 · δ ^ ε' · a ^ (4η) · a ^ ε · C · |N_{θb}(U(s, Y''))| ≤ |U(s, Y'')|,
```

`N_r` being `Metric.cthickening r`.  There is no region to construct, no cover to exhibit, and the
multiplicity has cancelled.  It is strictly weaker than the dense-region obligation on two counts.

* The discard is done in **mass** rather than in volume: a `θb`-ball is kept when
  `∑_i |Y''_i ∩ B̄(z, θb)| ≥ τ |B̄(z, θb)|`.  So a fixed *half* of the mass can always be retained,
  where the dense-region route — which must convert a union capture into a mass capture through
  `Plank.isCRefinement_restrictShade_of_dense`, at the price of one factor `C` — can never retain
  more than a `1/C` fraction, and therefore has to achieve a retention ratio
  `δ ^ (ε' - 2ε) a ^ ε` that tends to `1` as `a → 1`.
* The threshold `τ := δ ^ ε' a ^ (4η + ε) · C · m₀`, with `m₀` the minimal pointwise multiplicity,
  is exactly the factor `C · m₀` that `ShadedPlank.sum_volume_shade_inter_le_of_hasCConstantMultiplicity`
  charges to convert the surviving mass density into the union density Item 1 asks for, so `m₀`
  cancels.

The threshold witness is `δthr = 2 ^ (-1/ε)`, used exactly once, for `2 δ ^ (ε' - ε) ≤ 1`; that is
the only place `128 * ε ≤ ε'` enters, and it spends `2 * ε` of it.  The obligation carries the
constant `C`
the caller actually supplied rather than its bound `δ ^ (-ε)`.
`ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle_of_volumeLowerBound` is the crude corollary in which
the thickening is replaced by the window `B̄(0, 5)`, giving the `θ`-free and `b`-free obligation
`54 δ ^ ε' a ^ (4η + ε) C |B̄(0, 5)| ≤ |U(s, Y'')|`; that form is genuinely weaker than the theorem
(it fails for the extremal bush family) and is only for the regime where `θ b` is comparable to the
window.

The obligation is where the multiplicity hypothesis `2 ≤ δ ^ (-η) ≤ µ` must be used: a *single*
plank has thickening ratio `θ b / a`, which violates the obligation as soon as
`θ b ≫ a ^ (1 - 4η - ε)`, and it is the multiplicity hypothesis that excludes it.  For the two
extremal admissible shapes the obligation holds with room — the bush (`|s| = µ` planks through one
core box) has thickening ratio `a ^ (-η/2)` because the fullness hypothesis forces
`θ ≲ a ^ (1 - η/2)`, and the transverse plate (`θ ≈ 1`, `b ≈ 1`) has thickening ratio `a ^ (-η)`
because the same hypothesis forces the plate thickness `≳ a ^ η`; both are below the allowance
`a ^ (-4η - ε)`.

## One correction to the two "elementary facts" recorded below

Fact 1 below is true for Item 1 and **false for the fullness clause**, and that trap is now
certified. Restricting every shade to a *single* ball `B̄(z, θ b)` does give Item 1 outright, but
`ShadedPlank.denseBall_mass_forces_cube_bound` shows the resulting family can only satisfy the
fullness clause if `c1 * a ^ ε * λ(s, bodies Y) * a * b ≤ (θ b) ^ 3`, and
`ShadedPlank.singleBall_necessary_condition_fails` shows this is false for *every* `0 < a < 1`
at `δ = a`, `b = 1`, `θ = a / b`, `λ = a ^ η`, `c1 = δ ^ ε'` whenever `η + ε + ε' < 2`. One ball of
radius `θ b` holds volume `≈ (θ b) ^ 3` while the fullness clause asks for essentially all of the
mass `8 a b λ` of an average plank. The output family must be spread over many `θ b`-balls, which
is what the dense-region construction does.

For the record, two elementary facts established while scoping this. Writing `U'` for the retained
union:

1. A local-density statement transfers *upward* in radius for free and *downward* at the cost of an
   absolute constant only. Downward: if `U'` has density `t` in some ball `B̄(x₀, R)` with
   `R ≥ θ * b`, cover that ball by `O((R / (θ*b)) ^ 3)` balls of radius `θ * b`; the densest one
   `B̄(z, θ*b)` has `U'`-density at least `c * t` with `c` absolute *independent of the ratio*.
   Restricting every shade to `B̄(z, θ*b)` then yields the displayed Item 1 outright, since the
   restricted union lies in `B̄(z, θ*b)` and `B̄(z, θ*b) ⊆ B̄(x, 3 * θ * b)` for every `x` whose
   `θ*b`-ball meets it. **But see the correction above: the retained mass is then far too small
   for the fullness clause, so this is not a route to the theorem.**
2. Consequently, routing through `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` and its *produced* angle `θₚ`
   costs nothing when `θ ≤ 3 θₚ`, and its only public control on `θₚ` is `a / b ≤ θₚ ≤ 1`; in the
   worst case `θ / θₚ = b / a` the inflation loss is `(a/b) ^ 3`, which against `c1⁻¹ ≤ δ ^ (-ε')`
   would demand `ε' ≥ 3` where the consumer supplies `ε' = η / 2`. That route is therefore the
   wrong one, and the prescribed-angle producers above are the right one. A second, independent
   reason: `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` exposes no typicality clause for `θₚ`, so `θ` and `θₚ`
   cannot be compared at all.
