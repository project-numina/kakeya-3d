# Re-setting the working dimensions `(a, b)` of a configuration after the per-ball factoring

General-branch steps G1. GWZ §9.3 fix the
dimensions `a × b × r₁` of the factoring bodies **after** running the biased maximal density
factoring (Lemma 9.2) in every ball and pigeonholing (GWZ): "by pigeonholing,
we can suppose that for each `B`, the convex sets `W ∈ 𝕎_B` have dimensions `a × b × r₁`". In the
tree the working scales live in the configuration (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.a`, `.b`, `.hdims`),
while the ball cover and the segment family (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore`) never read
them. So the construction may run T2b (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_config_of_slackCut_at`,
at `a = b = δ`) and T3 (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ballDataCoreOfCover`) first, Lemma 9.2 second,
and re-set `(a, b)` third:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.withDims` replaces `a`, `b`, `hdims` of a configuration and nothing
  else — every other field is copied, which the `rfl` lemmas record;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallDataCore.withDims` transports a `BallDataCore` along it
  **definitionally** (`{ core with }`): no field of `BallDataCore` mentions `a` or `b`;
* the closing `example` is a tripwire: T2b's refinement clause reads the same on
  `withDims cfg a b h` as on `cfg`, so T2b is reused unchanged.
