# The slab case of the thin case of Main Lemma 2

This file formalizes the slab-case subsubsection of the blueprint
(GWZ): the case `b ≥ δ^{exscal} r₁ = δ^{2·exscal}` of
the very-not-sticky configuration, where `b` is the middle affine thickness of the factoring
bodies. In this case each `W ∈ 𝕎'_B` is a giant slab, with affine thicknesses
`τ₀(W) ∼ r₁ = δ^{exscal}`, `τ₁(W) ≳ δ^{2 exscal}` and `τ₂(W) ∼ a`, and GWZ Lemma 6.9 —
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` — applies to the rescaled family.

The chain of estimates is:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure` turns a family of convex bodies whose affine
  thicknesses are only *comparable* to `(r₁, b, a)`, with a given constant, into a family of
  `ShadedPrism3D` objects with *exact* half-widths `a/r₁ × b/r₁ × 1`, which is the shape
  `ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` demands. It is
  generic in that constant.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCarrierEnclosure` instantiates it at the family the shading
  `(tc.thinBall hB).W` actually shades, namely the *enlarged carriers*
  `fun j ↦ ((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody`, and therefore at the doubled constant
  `2 C₀`, which is the profile those carriers have by
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsChoice` fixes the parameter `ε` with `(a/r₁)^ε = δ^{exscal}`
  and the two half-width hypotheses, while
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismDensity` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismAntiClustering` discharge the density and anti-clustering
  hypotheses of GWZ Lemma 6.9 against (S1) and (S2). The second of those is where `Δ_max` is carried
  from the
  geometric bodies `bd.Wb`, which (C4) controls, to the enlarged carriers, which the enclosure
  consumes, by `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement` composed with
  `ConvexSpaceBody.IsVolumeControlledEnlargement.maxDensity_le`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` assembles those four and reads the gain back at the
  coarse scale: `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ C_{slabMultBound}(exscal) δ^{-8 exscal}`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionFromMult` converts the multiplicity bound into a lower bound
  for `|U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)|`, through `Kakeya.ThinCase.unionLower_thin`, and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnion` substitutes the former
  into the latter.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDensity` compares the mass of the retained tube segments with the
  mass of the factoring bodies, giving the per-ball estimate
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPerBall`.
* Summing over `B ∈ 𝔅` — the per-ball unions being pairwise disjoint
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionDisjoint`) and contained in `U(𝕋, Y)`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionSum`) — and applying
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabVolumeGoal` gives the volume form of the goal with gain `β/2`,
  which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_goalUnion` converts into `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge`.

Eight facts used by this chain are collected once, as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs`
, and every lemma of the chain that consumes one of them carries
the bundle as an explicit hypothesis. They are *produced*, not accepted:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputs` builds the bundle from the standing configuration together
with the thresholds `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale`. Four of the eight are items of
the standing configuration — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering` of (C4),
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_dilation` of (C3), `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tube_count` of (C1)
and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.segment_mass` of (T7) — and the remaining four, `δ < 1`
and the three threshold inequalities, are the fields of `SlabScale`, which is the `tc`-aware
companion of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`: two of them mention the thin-case comparison
constant `tc.C`, which `CaseScale` is stated before and therefore does not see.
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge` accordingly takes `SlabScale` as an extra hypothesis, at the cost of
one argument at its unique call site inside `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`.

All the per-ball data is read off the bundles: `𝕎'_B` is `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'`, its
shading `Y_{𝕎'_B}` is `(tc.thinBall hB).W`, the two shaded unions `U(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` and
`U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)` are `(tc.thinBall hB).UW` and `(tc.thinBall hB).U`, and the geometric bodies
themselves are `bd.Wb`.

The shaded bodies `(tc.thinBall hB).W` do *not* carry `bd.Wb` as their carrier: they carry a
controlled enlargement of it. All that is recorded about the two is the sandwich
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` / `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening`, and the
slab case reaches the geometric bodies from the carriers only through the transfer lemmas
derived from it — `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.sum_volume_Wb_le` in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodyMassBound`,
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement` in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismAntiClustering`, and
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W` in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCarrierEnclosure`. The statements of the chain from
`slabBodyMassBound` onwards are all phrased in `bd.Wb`, which is the currency the rest of the
argument and the final Main Lemma 2 bound speak in; only the bridging is about the carriers.

Nothing is taken as a free argument, exactly as in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.NonSlabCase`: with free data the branch hypotheses would be
satisfiable vacuously by the empty family.

/-! ### From convex bodies to exact prisms -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure`**.

`C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(C₀)` is a constant with the following property: whenever
`V ⊆ ℝ³` is a convex body whose affine thicknesses are comparable, with constant `C₀`, to
`(1, b', a')` with `0 < a' ≤ b' ≤ 1`, the `C₀`-dilate of the exact `a' × b' × 1` box aligned
with the John ellipsoid of `V` contains `V` and has volume at most
`C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(C₀) |V|`.

It is a function of `C₀` alone: not of `δ`, not of `a` or `b`, not of the ball `B`, and not of
the family. As for `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyConstant` it is a constant *by choice*
rather than by a formula — an admissible value is read off the John-ellipsoid comparison of
`Kakeya.HasThicknesses`, as a fixed power of `C₀` times an absolute constant — and no later
step uses its value; what is used is the volume comparison of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure` and the fact that one such constant serves every
body of every `𝕎'_B`. The displayed value is provisional. -/

/-- **Enclosing one rescaled body in an exact prism**.

The per-body step of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure`. The body `K`, whose affine
thicknesses are comparable to `(r₁, b, a)` with constant `C₀`, is enclosed in the box aligned
with its John ellipsoid, of exact half-widths `C₀ a × C₀ b × C₀ r₁`
(`Prism3D.exists_superset_volume_le_of_hasThicknesses`), and the whole picture is then dilated
by the ratio `ρ` about the origin (`Prism3D.homothety`, `ConvexSpaceBody.homothety`,
`ShadedBody.homothety`). The three equations `ha'`, `hb'`, `hone` say that this dilation turns
the half-widths into `a' × b' × 1`; at the call site `ρ = (C₀ r₁)⁻¹`, which is exactly what
makes the third one hold.

The volume loss is `Prism3D.enclosureVolumeConstant C₀ = 48 C₀⁶`, absorbed into the larger
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosureConstant C₀`; the dilation multiplies both volumes by
`ρ³` and therefore does not change it. The shading is carried along unchanged as a set, which
is why the shading of the prism is literally that of `V.homothety`. -/

/-- **Enclosing the rescaled bodies in exact prisms** (blueprint
`lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure`, absorbing blueprint `lem:ml2slabRescaleTransport`).

`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` (GWZ Lemma 6.9) is stated for prisms with *exact*
half-widths, whereas by (C4) the bodies of `𝕎'_B` are convex bodies whose affine thicknesses
are only comparable to `(r₁, b, a)`, with the constant `C₀`. This lemma performs the passage,
with its loss written out: for each body take the box of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosureConstant` aligned with its John ellipsoid, whose exact
half-widths are `C₀ a × C₀ b × C₀ r₁`, and apply the dilation `x ↦ (C₀ r₁)⁻¹ • x` to the whole
configuration. The resulting prisms have exact half-widths `a' × b' × 1` with `a' = a / r₁`
and `b' = b / r₁`.

The three conclusions are ratios of volumes, hence unaffected by the dilation. The shadings
are unchanged as sets, so `μ` is unchanged. For `λ` the numerator is unchanged and the
denominator grows by at most `C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(C₀)`. For `Δ_max`, if `K` is a
convex body then `K_P ⊆ K` forces `P ⊆ K`, so the sum over the enclosed prisms is at most
`C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(C₀)` times the sum over the enclosed bodies.

The blueprint states the enclosure (`lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure`) and the transport of the three
ratios across the affine rescaling `L_B` (`lem:ml2slabRescaleTransport`) as two lemmas, the
second one relative to the plank presentation of blueprint `lem:ml2plankpresentation` (Lean
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`, which lives in the non-slab file and is therefore not
available here without an import cycle). Both are folded into this single statement, which is
stated directly for the bodies of `𝕎'_B`: the intermediate plank family never has to be named,
and the transport of `λ`, `μ` and `Δ_max` across a homothety is already available as
`ShadedBody.multiplicity_homothety`, `Kakeya.maxDensity_homothety` and their translation
companions.

The normalization by `(C₀ r₁)⁻¹` rather than by `r₁⁻¹` is what keeps the small half-width
*exactly* `a / r₁`. Enclosing without renormalizing would give prisms of small half-width
`C₀ a / r₁`, and then the exponent `ε` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange`, which is read
off that half-width, would acquire a `δ`-dependent shift of size `log C₀ / log δ⁻¹`; the
window of `slabEpsRange` would no longer have endpoints depending on `exscal` alone, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBoundConstant` would not be a function of `exscal` alone.

Unlike `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`, this statement needs no sharpened middle-scale
hypothesis. That lemma *produces* its `a'` and `b'`, so it has to prove `b' ≤ 1` itself, and
since the middle half-width of the transported body is only known to be at most `C₀ (b / r₁)`
it assumes `C₀ * b ≤ r₁` for that purpose. Here `a'` and `b'` are *given*, pinned to `a / r₁`
and `b / r₁` by `ha'` and `hb'`, and the two order relations `a' ≤ b' ≤ 1` that the type
`ShadedPrism3D a' b' 1` requires are the hypotheses `hab'` and `hb1'`; the renormalization by
`(C₀ r₁)⁻¹` rather than by `r₁⁻¹` is exactly what removes the factor `C₀` from the half-widths,
so `b ≤ r₁` — that is, `hb1'` — is all that is needed. At the call site both `hab'` and `hb1'`
come from `δ ≤ a ≤ b ≤ δ^{exscal} = r₁` of (C4), the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hdims`, with no smallness condition on `δ`. -/

/-- **The window of the exponent `ε`**.

Write `a' = δ^θ` with `θ = log a' / log δ`. Since `0 < δ < 1` the map `s ↦ δ^s` is strictly
decreasing, so the two hypotheses read `1 - τ - exscal ≤ θ ≤ 1 - exscal`, and `θ > 0` because
`τ + exscal < 1` (the field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.thinScale`); hence `a' < 1`. The
defining equation `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` is `ε θ = exscal`, so `ε = exscal / θ`, and the
displayed window is the image of the window for `θ` under the decreasing map
`θ ↦ exscal / θ` on `θ > 0`.

The exponent is bound *existentially*, and `0 < a' < 1` is part of the conclusion rather than
of the hypotheses. This is what makes the lemma usable: the caller
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound`) has the two-sided bound on `a'` and nothing else, and
cannot exhibit an `ε` with `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` before knowing `0 < a' < 1` — for `a' = 1` no
such `ε` exists. The same two facts are, in addition, two of the four side conditions of
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow`, applied to a prism family whose small half-width is `a'`.

The defining equation is stated in `ℝ≥0∞`, which is the currency of
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` and of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRpowIdentity`, the two
declarations that consume it; the two-sided bound on `a'` is stated in `ℝ≥0`, which is the
currency of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabScaleBounds`, the declaration that produces it.

Only the lower bound of the window is consumed, by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slab1Constant_antitone`; the upper bound is recorded because it is what
shows the window is a window, and because it makes visible that `ε ≈ exscal`. -/

/-- **The gain of GWZ Lemma 6.9 is read at the coarse scale**.

Raising `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` to the power `-8`: `ENNReal.rpow_mul` gives
`(a')^{-8ε} = ((a')^ε)^{-8}` and `(δ^{exscal})^{-8} = δ^{-8 exscal}`, and the hypothesis
identifies the two middle terms.

No positivity or finiteness side condition is needed: `ENNReal.rpow_mul` holds for every base
in `[0, ∞]`, the degenerate cases `0` and `∞` being interchanged rather than lost by a negative
exponent. Both `a'` and `δ` are nevertheless positive where the lemma is applied.

The identity is separated out because it is the only point at which the conclusion of
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow`, which is expressed in the small half-width `a'` of the
prisms, is rewritten in the scale `δ` of the ambient configuration; keeping the `ℝ≥0∞` power
arithmetic out of the proof of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` keeps that proof to the
four hypothesis checks it is really about. -/

On `(0, ∞)` the map `η ↦ 1 / (2 η log 2)` is positive and decreasing, since `log 2 > 0`;
adding `2` and multiplying by `2695 > 0` preserves both properties. Consequently, if
`0 < η₀ ≤ η` then `C_{6.9}(η) ≤ C_{6.9}(η₀)`.

This is what lets `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBoundConstant` be evaluated at the *left*
endpoint `exscal / (1 - exscal)` of the window of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange`, which
depends only on the exponents fixed once and for all, while the parameter `ε` at which GWZ
Lemma 6.9 is actually applied moves with `δ`. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2slabMultBound`**.

`C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal) = C_{6.9}(exscal / (1 - exscal))`, where `C_{6.9}` is
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow.C`. It is a function of the coarse-scale exponent `exscal`
alone: not of `δ`, not of the ball `B`, not of the family or its factoring, not of the
thin-case exponent `τ`, and not of `C₀`.

The value at the *left* endpoint of the window of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange` is the
right one. GWZ Lemma 6.9 is applied in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` to the prism family
of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure`, whose small half-width is `a' = a / r₁`, with the
parameter `ε` determined by `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}`; by `slabEpsRange`,
`ε ∈ [exscal/(1-exscal), exscal/(1-τ-exscal)]`. So `ε` is not a fixed number: it moves with
`a'`, hence with `δ`, and `C_{6.9}(ε)` moves with it. What does not move is the left endpoint.
Since `C_{6.9}` is decreasing (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slab1Constant_antitone`) and
`ε ≥ exscal/(1-exscal)`, we get `C_{6.9}(ε) ≤ C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal)` for every
admissible `ε`, uniformly in `δ`. Evaluating at the right endpoint would not do: it is the
smaller of the two values, so not an upper bound, and it would carry a spurious dependence
on `τ`. -/

density bound (T2), the second is the loss of `Kakeya.ThinCase.unionLower_thin` when the
estimate is transported from the factoring bodies to the tube segments. It is therefore *not*
the constant of either.

Like both of its factors it depends on `C` and on `C₀` only: not on `δ`, and not on the ball
`B`. Ball-independence is what makes the resulting estimate summable over `B ∈ 𝔅` in
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge`, where a per-ball constant would have to be replaced by a supremum
over `𝔅` that no hypothesis controls. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` into `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionFromMult`, and the
multiplicity enters the latter through the factor `M` on the right-hand side; so the two
losses multiply and this constant is their product, and is *not* the constant of either
lemma. It depends on `C`, on `C₀` and on `exscal` only, and in particular neither on `δ` nor

/-- **The segments retained by the factoring**.

`𝕋_B^{𝕎'} = {T_B ∈ 𝕋_B : W(T_B) ∈ 𝕎'_B}`, the set of tube segments of the ball `B` whose
block was retained by the factoring proposition. The block of a segment is `bd.blk`, which is
well defined because the decomposition `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}` of (C4) is a partition.

The restriction is necessary and costs nothing: a segment whose block was discarded by the
factoring is not contained in any body of `𝕎'_B`, so it cannot be counted on the right-hand
side of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabSegmentSumSplit`, while by (T3)
(`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.shade_containment`) every segment carrying any of the final shading
`Y'_B` has its block in `𝕎'_B`. -/

/-- **Constant in Definition `hyp:ml2slabinputs`**.

`C_{hyp:ml2slabinputs}(C₀) = max(1, C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(2 C₀) ·
volume_comparison.C 3)`, with `volume_comparison.C 3 = 4³ · 3! = 384` the dimensional volume
comparison constant. It is written as `Metric.volume_comparison.C 3` rather than as the
blueprint's `C_{lem:outerFactoringVolumeControlled}(3)`, which is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_volumeControlled.C 3`, because the latter is by definition the
former and lives in a module this file does not import; the same choice is made by
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyConstant`.

Two factors, and each is one of the two losses that separate the *geometric* bodies `bd.Wb j`
of `𝕎'_B`, which are what (C4) controls, from the exact prisms to which GWZ Lemma 6.9 is
finally applied.

*The first factor is the enclosure, evaluated at `2 C₀` and not at `C₀`.* The family that
carries the shading `Y_{𝕎'_B}` — and hence the family whose fullness and whose maximal density
GWZ Lemma 6.9 is asked about — is not `bd.Wb` but the family of enlarged carriers
`fun j ↦ ((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody`, the
upper half of the sandwich `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` /
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening`. By
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W` those carriers inherit the thickness profile
`(r₁, b, a)` of the bodies with the comparison constant *doubled*, and with nothing better
available, the enlargement being by `τ₂(Wb j)`, which is of the same order as the shortest
thickness itself. So `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure` has to be run at comparison
constant `2 C₀`. That is the only effect the enlargement has on this factor: the half-widths of
the prisms it produces are still exactly `a' × b' × 1` with `a' = a / r₁` and `b' = b / r₁`,
because `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosureBody` normalizes by whichever comparison
constant it is handed, so the doubling cancels and the window of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange` is untouched.

*The second factor is what the passage between the two families costs in `Δ_max`.* The
anti-clustering hypothesis of (C4) is a statement about the geometric bodies, whereas the
enclosure consumes one about the carriers, and `Δ_max` is not monotone in either direction
under an enlargement of the members of a family. What bridges the two is
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement`, which makes the carriers a
`volume_comparison.C 3`-volume-controlled enlargement of `bd.Wb` in the sense of
`ConvexSpaceBody.IsVolumeControlledEnlargement`, together with
`ConvexSpaceBody.IsVolumeControlledEnlargement.maxDensity_le`, which transfers the bound at the
cost of exactly that factor. Nothing more is charged, and in particular no property of the
factoring construction is used, only the sandwich.

On the density side the second factor is not needed: `λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` is already the
fullness of the *shaded* family, whose denominator is the sum of the volumes of the carriers, so
(S1) would run with `C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(2 C₀)` alone. It is charged the product all
the same, because one constant serves both items of the bundle and because
`volume_comparison.C 3 ≥ 1` makes the larger value an admissible threshold for the smaller
requirement; the cost is a fixed numerical factor in a threshold on `δ`, and the exponent
budgets of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` are untouched by it.

It is a function of `C₀` alone: not of `δ`, not of `a` or `b`, not of the ball `B`, not of the
family, and not of the exponent parameters. The truncation at `1` is inactive, both factors
being at least `1`, so it changes no value; it is written so that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.one_le_slabInputsConstant` is available without an argument, and to match
the shape of the other constants of this file. -/

`#fibre · c₃ δ² ≤ Δ_max · |fibreBody|` (`CanonicalCapsulesFibre.lean`): at `ε = δ`,
`L = r₁/8`, `δ ≤ r₁/16`, `r₁ ≤ 1` it reads
`#fibre ≤ (4356/c₃) · Δ_max · r₁^{-2} = (9801/π) · Δ_max · r₁^{-2} ≈ 3120 · Δ_max · r₁^{-2}`,
over-estimated by `Real.pi_gt_three` to `9801/3 = 3267`; at the producer's actual half-length
`L = r₁/4` (`CoverData.capsuleCore`, `CanonicalCapsulesProducer.lean`, `card_fib_le_fibreMass`)
the compiled bound is `(1960/c₃) · Δ_max · r₁^{-2} ≈ 1403 · Δ_max · r₁^{-2}` — both sit under
`3267`, which therefore stands.  The refined `320` is the same shape at their sharper capsule
geometry.  The producer may raise it to any explicit `δ`-free numeral, and must record the
measurement.

It lives here and not in `MainLemma2/EDConstants.lean` because `EDConstants` transitively
imports this file, while `SlabScale` below reads it. -/

/-- **Fixed-scale thresholds for the slab case**.

The `tc`-aware companion of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`: the strict inequality `δ < 1`
together with the four thresholds the slab case needs. It exists as a separate
structure for one reason: two of its assertions mention the thin-case comparison constant
`tc.C`, which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` does not see, being stated before the thin-case
data is constructed. Accordingly it takes `cfg`, `bd`, `tc` and `τ`.

No enlargement of the *data* of the standing configuration can supply these: `cfg` fixes `δ`
before the case split and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` deliberately records no condition
on `δ` at all, while `density` and `final` compare `δ` with `tc.C` and `bd.C₀`, and every field
of `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` is of the weakening shape `X ≤ C · Y` or `C⁻¹ · X ≤ Y`, so from
any `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig` with constant `C` one obtains one with an arbitrarily
larger constant. A `δ`-free hypothesis therefore cannot imply them.

The first four assertions hold once the exponent parameters and the constants have been fixed
and `δ` is taken small enough. Each of the three fixed-scale thresholds is of the shape
`C ≤ δ^{-s}` with `s > 0`, the three gaps being `exscal - 6η > 0`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slabDensity`), `exscal - 2ϱ > 0`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slabBias`, whose separation constant is `2^20 ≥ 2`) and
`β/2 - (12η+12 exscal+3τ) > 0` (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab`). Each is spent exactly
once: `density` converts the density `δ^{6η}` of (T2) into the input `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` that
`ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` demands, `antiClustering` converts the honest exponent
`2ϱ` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering` into the `exscal` the same lemma
demands, and `final` is the only place in the slab case where a `δ`-free comparison constant is
discharged — which is what allows the conclusion of `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge` to be the
constant-free currency `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion`. The `δ`-free constants it absorbs are
`C_{lem:ml2slabUnion}(C, C₀, exscal)`, the thin-case constant `C` and the dilation constant
`bd.Cdil` that the repaired clauses (T7) and (C3) put on the right of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMassBound`.

The fifth assertion, `fibreMass`, is of a different kind: it bounds the fibre-count scale
`Cm · m` of (C5) — a datum of `bd`, not a `δ`-free constant — by the budgeted power
`δ^{-(η+2 exscal)}`. It is what the repaired (T7) costs beyond `δ^{2η}`: `m` is bounded only
through the size of the parent families `|𝕋(T_B)|`, so it is not absorbed by a fixed-scale
gap but budgeted, and its budget `η + 2 exscal` is the difference between the exponent
`12η + 12 exscal + 3τ` of `final` and the honest `11η + 10 exscal + 3τ` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMassBound`, which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabVolumeGoal` takes with no
margin since F8 spent the former `4η`. Whoever produces the side data must arrange it.

`deltaLtOne` is grouped here rather than with the exponent budgets because it is a condition on
`δ`: `cfg` records only `δ ≤ 1`, whereas `ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange` both need strictness, since at `δ = 1` every scale
collapses and the exponent `ε` is not determined. -/

  own index `η` (see that field) and is read by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.tb` at the

  repair (`9η+10 exscal+3τ` then); the two extra `δ`-free factors `C` and `Cdil` come from the
  repaired (T7) and (C3), and the third,

/-- **Inputs of the slab case**.

The eight facts used in the proof of `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge`, collected once as a named
bundle rather than restated in each of the six lemmas that consume them.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputs` produces the bundle, so nothing here is assumed.

They are of two kinds. `deltaLtOne`, `densityThreshold` (S1), `finalThreshold` (S6) and
`fibreMassThreshold` (S7) are *thresholds*: the first three are fixed-scale, of the shape
`C ≤ δ^{-s}` with `s > 0` and `C` independent of `δ`, and (S7) bounds the fibre-count datum
`Cm · m` of (C5) by its budgeted power; they are four of the five fields of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale` verbatim, and they are not derivable from `δ`-free data
because `δ` is fixed before the case split.
`bodiesAntiClustering` (S2), `segsDilation` (S3), `tubeCount` (S4) and `segmentMass` (S5) are
items of the standing configuration: (S3) is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_dilation` of (C3), (S4) is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tube_count` of (C1) and (S5) is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.segment_mass` of (T7), each verbatim, while (S2) is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering` of (C4) restricted to the retained
subfamily and with the two constants discharged against
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.antiClustering`.

Every estimate below is stated division-free, so no positivity or finiteness side condition is
needed:

* (S1) reads `C · C_{hyp:ml2slabinputs}(C₀) · δ^{exscal} ≤ δ^{6η}`; it is the only place where
  the budget `6η < exscal` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slabDensity` is spent, converting
  the density `δ^{6η}` of (T2) at the `tb` index `2η` into the input `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` that
  GWZ Lemma 6.9 demands.
* (S2) reads `C_{hyp:ml2slabinputs}(C₀) · Δ_max(𝕎'_B) ≤ δ^{-exscal}`, for every `B ∈ 𝔅`, the
  `Δ_max` being that of the *geometric* bodies `bd.Wb`.
* (S3) reads `r₁² Δ_max(𝕋_B) ≤ Cdil · Δ_max(𝕋)`, the division-free form of the blueprint's
  `Δ_max(𝕋_B) ≤ r₁^{-2} Δ_max(𝕋)` with the comparison constant `bd.Cdil` made explicit.
* (S4) reads `1 ≤ δ |𝕋|`, the division-free form of the blueprint's `|𝕋| ≥ δ^{-1}`.
* (S5) reads `δ^{2η} ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |T| ≤ C · Cm · m · ∑_{B ∈ 𝔅} ∑_{T_B ∈ 𝕋_B^{𝕎'}} |T_B|`, with
  `𝕋_B^{𝕎'}` the retained segments `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.retainedSegments`, the density loss
  and the fibre count made explicit.
* (S6) reads `C · Cdil · C_{lem:ml2slabUnion}(C, C₀, exscal) · δ^{β/2} ≤ δ^{12η+12 exscal+3τ}`,
  the division-free form of the blueprint's
  `C_{lem:ml2slabUnion} ≤ δ^{-(β/2 - (12η+12 exscal+3τ))}` with the two constants of (S3) and
  (S5) adjoined, the exponent being positive by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab`. It is
  the only place in the slab case where a `δ`-free comparison constant is discharged, which is
  what allows the conclusion to be the constant-free currency
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion`.
* (S7) reads `Cm · m ≤ δ^{-(η+2 exscal)}`: the fibre-count scale of (C5) that (S5) puts on the
  right is within its budget `η + 2 exscal`, the difference between the exponent of (S6) and
  the honest `11η+10 exscal+3τ` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMassBound`, which
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabVolumeGoal` takes with no margin (F8).

The field `deltaLtOne` is an eighth item, of the same fixed-scale kind as (S1) and (S6):
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` records only `δ ≤ 1`, whereas `ShadedPrism3D.multiplicity_le_rpow` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange` both need the strict inequality (at `δ = 1` all the scales
collapse and the exponent `ε` is not determined). It comes from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale`, with (S1), (S6) and (S7); the blueprint records it with (S1).

The bundle depends on the thin-case exponent `τ`, through (S6) only.

The bundle is *kept* rather than dissolved into the enlarged configuration, and this is a
matter of exposition: the six lemmas below can then name (S1), (S2), (S3) individually, and the
reader is not sent to four different bundles to find out what a given step needs. Every lemma
of this subsubsection that consumes an item takes the structure as an explicit hypothesis, and
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge` applies `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputs` once.

An earlier state of this file carried (S1)–(S6) as *accepted assumptions*, with the slab case
proved modulo them and the whole gap sitting in `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge`. The two changes that
closed that gap were recording the four configuration items where they belong — (S2) on (C4),
(S3) on (C3), (S4) on (C1), (S5) on (T7) — and adding the thresholds as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale`, which is threaded into `Kakeya.goalMult_of_b_ge` at the cost
of one argument at its unique call site inside `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`. -/

/-! ### The prism family of the slab case

GWZ Lemma 6.9 is applied once in this file, and applying it takes four steps beyond naming the
family it is applied to — the enlarged carriers
`fun j ↦ ((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody` of blueprint `def:ml2slabCarriers`, which is
available as a term and needs no declaration of its own. The four are: enclosing that family in
exact prisms, choosing the parameter `ε` together with the two half-width hypotheses that go
with it, and checking the density and the anti-clustering. Each is separated out below, so that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` is the assembly it ought to be.

The separation is forced by the enlargement sandwich `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` /
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening`: the family GWZ Lemma 6.9 is applied to is *not* the
family (C4) controls, and keeping the passage between them inside a single proof made that proof
carry the enlargement, the enclosure, the choice of `ε` and two constant-chasing chains at
once. -/

/-- **Enclosing the shaded carriers in exact prisms**.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosure`, applied to the family of enlarged carriers
`fun j ↦ ((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody` — which is what the shading
`(tc.thinBall hB).W` actually shades — at comparison constant `2 bd.C₀`. Its thickness
hypothesis is `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W` applied to
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_thickness` of (C4), which is where the doubling of the
comparison constant comes from; its shading hypothesis holds by `rfl`, the family being the
carriers of the shaded bodies themselves; and `0 < a`, `0 < r₁` are `cfg.hdims` with `cfg.hδ`
and `r₁ = δ^{exscal} > 0`.

The half-widths are exactly `a' × b' × 1`, with `a' = a / r₁` and `b' = b / r₁`, and not `2 C₀`
times anything: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismEnclosureBody` normalizes by the reciprocal of
whichever comparison constant it is handed, so the doubling cancels. This is what keeps the
window of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange` — and with it
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBoundConstant` — a function of `exscal` alone. The doubling is
charged only in the comparison constant, and is one of the two factors of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputsConstant`.

The third conclusion is stated against the maximal density of the *carriers* and not of the
geometric bodies `bd.Wb`, because that is what the enclosure produces; the passage to the
geometric bodies is the second factor of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputsConstant` and is
carried out in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismAntiClustering`, where it is composed with (S2) in
one chain. -/

Write `C = tc.C` and chain

≤ C · C_{lem:ml2slabPrismEnclosure}(2 C₀) · λ(P) ≤ C · C_{hyp:ml2slabinputs}(C₀) · λ(P)`,
the first step being (S1), the second `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies` of (T2), the
third the hypothesis, and the fourth
`slabPrismEnclosureConstant (2 C₀) ≤ slabInputsConstant C₀`, which holds because
`volume_comparison.C 3 = 384 ≥ 1`. Cancelling the common factor
`C · C_{hyp:ml2slabinputs}(C₀)` is legitimate in `ℝ≥0∞` because it is positive and finite, both
constants being reals at least `1`.

The lemma is stated for an arbitrary shaded family `P` carried by the index set of `𝕎'_B`,
rather than for the prism family of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCarrierEnclosure`: nothing but the
displayed fullness comparison is used, and stating it this way keeps the dependent

/-- **Choosing the parameter `ε` of GWZ Lemma 6.9**.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabScaleBounds` gives `δ^{1-exscal} ≤ a' ≤ δ^{1-τ-exscal}` and
`b' ≥ δ^{exscal}`, with `a' = a / r₁` and `b' = b / r₁`.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsRange`, applied with that window and with `0 < δ < 1`, gives
`0 < a' < 1` together with an `ε` satisfying `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}` and
`ε ≥ exscal / (1 - exscal)`, the latter being positive since `0 < exscal < 1/2`. The two
remaining inequalities are rewritings of the defining equation: `b' ≥ δ^{exscal} = (a')^ε` is
the slab case, in the form `slabScaleBounds` just gave it, and `1 ≥ δ^{exscal} = (a')^ε` holds
because `δ ≤ 1` and `exscal > 0`.

The four conclusions about `ε` are exactly what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` has to hand
to GWZ Lemma 6.9 about the parameter: the defining equation, which is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRpowIdentity` then converts; the lower bound, which is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slab1Constant_antitone` then consumes; and the two half-width hypotheses.
The other two hypotheses of GWZ Lemma 6.9, the density and the anti-clustering, are about the
family rather than about `ε`, which is why they are separated from this one.

`δ < 1` is passed as its own hypothesis rather than through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs`: it is the only item of the bundle this lemma would use, and
taking it directly keeps the lemma independent of the ball and of the bundle. -/

/-! ### The multiplicity of the factoring bodies -/

/-- **Multiplicity of the factoring bodies in the slab case**.

Assume Configurations `hyp:ml2setup` and `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, the thin-case refinement
`a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`, the slab hypothesis `b ≥ δ^{2 exscal}` and the inputs (S1), (S2). Then
`μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal) δ^{-8 exscal}` for every `B ∈ 𝔅`.

Put `a' = a / r₁` and `b' = b / r₁`; the order relations `a' ≤ b' ≤ 1` hold by `a ≤ b ≤ r₁` of
(C4). Let `(P, Y_P)` be the exact `a' × b' × 1` prism family supplied by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCarrierEnclosure`; it is non-empty by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodiesNonempty`, its index set being that of `𝕎'_B`. Fix `ε` as in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabEpsChoice`, whose hypothesis `δ < 1` is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs.deltaLtOne`; it supplies at once `0 < a' < 1`, the defining
equation `(a')^ε = δ^{exscal}`, the bound `ε ≥ exscal/(1-exscal) > 0`, and the two half-width
hypotheses `b' ≥ (a')^ε` and `1 ≥ (a')^ε` of GWZ Lemma 6.9.

The two remaining hypotheses of GWZ Lemma 6.9 for `(P, Y_P)` with parameter `ε` are the density
`λ(P, Y_P) ≥ δ^{exscal} = (a')^ε`, which is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismDensity`, and the
anti-clustering `Δ_max(P) ≤ δ^{-exscal} = (a')^{-ε}`, which is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismAntiClustering`, each applied to the comparison that
`slabCarrierEnclosure` supplies.

The conclusion of GWZ Lemma 6.9 is therefore
`μ(P, Y_P) ≤ C_{6.9}(ε) (a')^{-8ε} = C_{6.9}(ε) δ^{-8 exscal}`, which is at most
`C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal) δ^{-8 exscal}`,
the equality being `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRpowIdentity` and the last step
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slab1Constant_antitone` at `η₀ = exscal/(1-exscal)`; and
`μ(P, Y_P) = μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` by `slabCarrierEnclosure`.

The choice `ε = η` would *not* do, because `η ≪ exscal` makes `(a')^η ≈ δ^η` larger than
`δ^{exscal}`, and the hypothesis `b' ≥ (a')^ε` then fails for bodies whose middle thickness is
as small as `b = δ^{2 exscal}`. This is why the parameter is written `ε` throughout: it is a
parameter of GWZ Lemma 6.9, at the scale of `exscal`, and not the density exponent `cfg.η`. -/

/-! ### From the multiplicity bound to the union bound -/

/-- **Mass of the factoring bodies against their shaded union**.

By `ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul` and `ShadedBody.multiplicity_mul_union`,
applied to the shaded family of `𝕎'_B` — whose carriers are, by the enlargement sandwich
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` / `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening`, the enlarged
bodies and not the `bd.Wb j` themselves —
`λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ∑_j |carrier(W_j)| = ∑_j |Y_{𝕎'_B}(W_j)| =
μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) |U(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})|`.
It is the sum of the *carrier* volumes that appears on the left, because the denominator of `λ`
is the total volume of the family that is being shaded. Multiplying the density bound (T2),
`δ^{6η} ≤ C λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` (at the `tb` index `2η`), by that same sum and using
`μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ M` gives the displayed bound for `δ^{6η} ∑_j |carrier(W_j)|`.

The geometric bodies re-enter only at the last step, through
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.sum_volume_Wb_le`, which bounds
`∑_{W ∈ 𝕎'_B} |W| ≤ ∑_j |carrier(W_j)|` and so yields the conclusion. The comparison is used in
the only direction available, and it is the useful one, the conclusion being an *upper* bound
for `∑_{W ∈ 𝕎'_B} |W|`.

This is the only place in the slab case where the two ratios `μ` and `λ` appear cleared of their
divisions, and it carries no side condition: both `ShadedBody.multiplicity_mul_union` and
`ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul` are division-free identities in `ℝ≥0∞`.

The statement is about `∑_{W ∈ 𝕎'_B} |W|` and not about `|𝕎'_B| |W|`: the two are comparable by
(C4), but only up to a power of `C₀`, and writing the sum avoids both that loss and the choice of
a reference body, exactly as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion` writes `∑_T |T|` rather than
`|𝕋| |T|`. It is about the *geometric* bodies and not the carriers because that is the sum the
rest of the chain wants: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabSegmentSumSplit` bounds the retained segment
mass by `Δ_max(𝕋_B) ∑_{W ∈ 𝕎'_B} |W|`, and the containment of a segment in its block, which is
what that lemma rests on, is a statement about the geometric body of (C4) and not about any
enlargement of it. The comparison happens to run in the direction that makes this free.

The blueprint states this with the extra hypothesis `M ≥ 1`; it is not used, so it is
dropped. -/

/-- **From the multiplicity bound to the union bound**.

Multiply the conclusion of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodyMassBound` by `δ^{3τ+2η}` and feed it
into `Kakeya.ThinCase.unionLower_thin` at the `tb` index `2η`, in the explicit form
`C_{lem:ml2thinUnionLower}(C,C₀)⁻¹ δ^{3τ+2η} |U(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})| ≤ |U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)|`. The density
constant of (T2) *is* the comparison constant `C` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` — in
Lean both are the field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.C` — so the two losses compose as
`C · C_{lem:ml2thinUnionLower}(C, C₀)`, which is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionFromMultConstant`.

`Kakeya.ThinCase.unionLower_thin` is what consumes the thin-case hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`,
which is why it appears among the hypotheses although nothing else in the proof uses it; it
further needs `0 < δ` and `δ ≤ a`, which are `cfg.hδ` and `cfg.hdims`, and that the ambient
dimension is three.

As in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodyMassBound` the blueprint's hypothesis `M ≥ 1` is not used
and is dropped. -/

/-- **The shaded union is large inside one ball, slab case**.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMultBound` gives `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ M` with
`M = C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal) δ^{-8 exscal}`, so
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionFromMult` applies with this `M` and yields
`δ^{3τ+8η} ∑_W |W| ≤ C_{lem:ml2slabUnionFromMult}(C,C₀) C_{lem:ml2slabMultBound}(exscal)
δ^{-8 exscal} |U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)|`, which is the claim after multiplying both sides by
`δ^{8 exscal}` and reading off `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionConstant`.

The exponent is `8η` — the honest value produced by the two lemmas above at the `tb` index
`2η` (F8) — and not the `12η` of the budget `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab`. The slack
is not decoration: one further power of `δ^η` is spent in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDensity`,
where the anti-clustering bound of (C1) is only `Δ_max(𝕋) ≤ δ^{-η}` and not `Δ_max(𝕋) ≤ 1`;
`2η` is the density loss of the repaired segment-mass clause (T7),
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs.segmentMass`; and `η` (with `2 exscal`) pays for its fibre
count in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.fibreMass`. Nothing is left over: the `4η` of margin
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabVolumeGoal` had before F8 is exactly what the (C5) exponent `2η`
costs along this chain. -/

has no comparison constant of its own: the `Cdil` is the one (S3) carries, passed through.

Multiply the conclusion of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDensity` by `δ^{8η+8 exscal+3τ}` and
substitute it into `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnion`. With `r₁² = δ^{2 exscal}` the left-hand
exponent is `(8η+8 exscal+3τ) + η + 2 exscal = 9η+10 exscal+3τ`. The dilation constant `Cdil`
of (S3) rides along on the right. -/

/-- **The per-ball unions are pairwise disjoint**.

By (C3) the shading `Y'_B` satisfies `Y'_B(T_B) ⊆ Y_B(T_B) ⊆ T_B ∩ B̂` — the fields
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.shade_Y'_subset` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.Y_piece` — so
`U(𝕋_B, Y'_B) ⊆ B̂`. The pieces `B̂`, `B ∈ 𝔅`, are pairwise disjoint by (C2)
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.P_disjoint`), hence so are the sets `U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)`, and
countable additivity of Lebesgue measure on a finite disjoint family gives the displayed
equality.

The family is indexed by `bd.bs.attach` because `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.thinBall`
needs the membership proof. -/

/-- **Reaching the volume form of the goal**.

The hypothesis is the honest `δ^{11η+10 exscal+3τ}` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMassBound`
(before F8 it read `7η` and was weakened here to `11η`; the (C5) exponent `2η` in the density clause spent exactly that `4η` margin), and the two thresholds absorb the constant
`K = C · Cm · m · Cdil · C_{lem:ml2slabUnion}(C,C₀,exscal)`: (S6) gives
`C · Cdil · C_{lem:ml2slabUnion} · δ^{β/2} ≤ δ^{12η+12 exscal+3τ}` and (S7) gives
`Cm · m ≤ δ^{-(η+2 exscal)}`, so `K δ^{β/2} ≤ δ^{11η+10 exscal+3τ}` and
`K δ^{β/2} ∑_T |T| ≤ δ^{11η+10 exscal+3τ} ∑_T |T| ≤ K |U(𝕋,Y)|`; cancelling `K` gives
`δ^{β/2} ∑_T |T| ≤ |U(𝕋,Y)|`.
By (S4), `|𝕋|^β ≥ δ^{-β}`, so
`δ^{β/2} |U(𝕋,Y)| |𝕋|^β ≥ δ^{-β/2} |U(𝕋,Y)| ≥ ∑_T |T|`, which is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalUnion` with gain `ν = β/2`. -/

No distinguished ball is taken: the argument uses *all* balls of `𝔅`, and the pairwise

/-- **Main Lemma 2, slab case**.

In the configuration `cfg`, together with the per-ball data `bd` of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup` and the thin-case data `tc` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over it, and
with the thin-case refinement `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`, suppose we are in the *slab case*, i.e.
`b ≥ δ^{exscal} r₁ = δ^{2·exscal}` for the convex bodies `W ∈ 𝕎_B`. Then the goal
`μ(𝕋, Y) ≤ δ^ν |𝕋|^β` holds with the explicit gain `ν = β/2`.

The gain is stated explicitly rather than existentially because it is the value
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinExponent` hard-codes for this branch. The exact inequality making
the exponent `β - 12η - 12·exscal - 3τ` — the blueprint's `β - 9η - 10·exscal - 3τ` after the
repaired (T7) and (C3) — at least `β/2` is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab`.

The proof sums the per-ball estimate `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPerBall` over `B ∈ 𝔅`, applies
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabUnionSum` on the right and the segment-mass input (S5) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs` on the left, obtaining
`δ^{11η+10 exscal+3τ} ∑_T |T| ≤ C · Cm · m · Cdil · C_{lem:ml2slabUnion}(C,C₀,exscal) |U(𝕋,Y)|`;
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabVolumeGoal` turns this into the volume form of the goal with gain
`β/2`, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_goalUnion` converts it into the multiplicity
currency with no constant lost.

No distinguished ball is taken, since the argument uses *all* balls of `𝔅`;
`bd.bs_nonempty` and the pairwise disjointness of the pieces `B̂` are what make the summation
legitimate.

Beyond the two Configurations and the two case hypotheses the statement assumes only the
fixed-scale bundle `ss : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale cfg bd tc τ`, which is what lets it
apply `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputs` internally and so assume nothing else. The further
facts the proof uses are the eight inputs `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs`, and they are now
*produced*, not accepted: four are items of the standing configuration — (S2) on (C4), (S3) on
(C3), (S4) on (C1), (S5) on (T7) — and the remaining four, `δ < 1`, (S1), (S6) and (S7), are
the fields of `ss`. They cannot be fields of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, since two of them
mention the thin-case constant `tc.C`, which that bundle is stated before.

The extra hypothesis costs one argument at the unique call site inside
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`, from where it is threaded up to
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_goalMult`. -/
