In this file, we prove the tangential case of the non-slab case
of the thin case of Main Lemma 2.

The three auxiliary statements are the ones the blueprint proof of `lem:ml2tangential`
consumes: the reduction to a single dense slab (`lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp`), the
multiplicity estimate inside that slab (`lem:ml2tangentialSlabMult`), and the combination of
the non-slab splitting with the Katz–Tao bound at the ball `B` (`lem:ml2tangentialSplit`).
Every *exponent* loss of the blueprint is made explicit against the single budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.parameterSeparationConstant`, each of the three lemmas spending a
quarter of it, so that the tangential budget `params.tangential` alone closes the argument
with no further smallness assumption on `δ`.

*Constants are not exponents.* By the constant/exponent distinction of the blueprint
(the paragraph opening the tangential subsubsection), the budget governs exponent losses
only: since `δ` is allowed up to `1`, a factor `δ^{-s}` with `s > 0` is `≥ 1` but does not
dominate a given constant. Multiplicative constants are therefore either carried by name in
the statements — `tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C` in the density clause, `Cμ` in the
multiplicity clause, `CΔ` in the rescaled slab — or discharged by an explicit fixed-scale
threshold of the shape `C ≤ δ^{-s}`.

*Two currencies, two refinement factors.* The pair `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` accompanying the
typical angle is only a `c`-refinement of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` with `δ^{2η} ≤ c`, and by
blueprint `lem:ml2fullnessRefine` and `lem:ml2multRefine` that costs a factor `c` in the
fullness *and* a factor `c` in the multiplicity. Both clauses of `tangentialSlabDecomp`
therefore carry it: in the density clause it compounds with the `δ^{2η}` of `(T2)` and
raises the exponent to `δ^{8η}`, and in the
multiplicity clause it is one further power `δ^{-2η}`, charged — together with the
`δ^{-2τ'}` of the fibre count and the `δ^{-τ'}` paying for `Cμ` — to that lemma's quarter
budget `C_sep τ'/4`, which `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecompExponent` verifies with room to
spare. Earlier drafts of both clauses dropped the refinement factor; the `2η`/`tc.C` form of
the density clause is not derivable (blueprint gives a counterexample).

/-- **Constant in Lemma `tangentialSlabDecomp`** (blueprint
`def:ml2tangentialSlabDecompConstant`, `C_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp}`).

`C_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp}(C^λ) = 100 C^λ`, where `C^λ = tc.C` is the density comparison
constant of blueprint `def:ml2thinFullnessConstant`, the one appearing in the explicit form
`densityWWBexplicit` of (T2).

The factor `100` is the reciprocal of the slab-selection threshold of blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialDenseSlabs`: only the slabs with
`λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S}) ≥ (1/100) λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` are kept, so the density guaranteed at the
selected slab is that of `𝕎''_B` divided by `100`. That factor is absolute: it depends neither
on the ambient dimension, nor on `δ`, nor on the ball `B`, nor on the slab `S`, nor on any
parameter of blueprint `hyp:ml2params`. Hence the constant is a function of `tc.C` alone and,
like it, is sub-polynomial in `δ⁻¹` rather than independent of `δ` — which is what makes the
fixed-scale threshold `hCdens` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` available. -/
def tangentialSlabDecompConstant (C : ℝ≥0) : ℝ≥0 := 100 * C

/-- **Constant in blueprint `lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation`** — retained, since
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabConeCountConstant` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant` are both built from it (blueprint
`c_{lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation}(C₀)`).

A constant in `(0, 1]`, depending only on the thickness comparison constant `C₀` of (C3)/(C4)
and on the comparison constants of (S2), below which the normals of two distinct slabs of a
slab family are not allowed to approach one another, measured in units of `a/b`. It is small,
hence named `c` and not `C`. The word "axis" in the name is retained from before the
correction to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle`; the direction compared is the normal
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`. The displayed value is provisional: it is fixed by clause (S4) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`, and only its range `(0, 1]` and its dependence on `C₀`
alone are used downstream, through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant`.

`noncomputable` is forced, not decorative: `NNReal.instInv` is itself noncomputable (it goes
through `Real.instInv`, which is choice-based), so the inversion cannot be compiled. -/

/-- **The cone-count constant of the lattice slab cells** — the `δ`-free constant of
clause (S4″) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`.

The GWZ proof builds the slab cells as a *bounded-overlap cover*, not a tiling: "use a
fixed net of normals and a lattice only in the normal coordinate; the two tangential
directions are not tiled" (GWZ),
and "at a shaded point, the typical-angle property confines all relevant normals to one
`O(θ)`-cap; separation of the normal net and of the one-dimensional lattice therefore leaves
only `O(1)` possible slab labels". The two factors of that `O(1)` are the
`⌈C/c⌉ + 1` lattice translates per net normal and the number of net cells *in the cap*, and
the second factor is why clause (S4″) is **cone-restricted**: over all directions at once the
count is `≍ (b/a)²/κ²`, since the net of normals of  ranges over every direction. The value carried here is the aperture-over-separation square
`C_{lem:coneDirectionCount} (3 / c_{lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation}(C₀))²`, i.e. the cell count of a
cone of aperture `3 (a/b)` at resolution `c(C₀) (a/b)`; clause (S4″) states the count per unit
of `α/(a/b)`, so the typicality factor `Ctyp` and the tangential `δ^{-τ'}` are *not* in it —
they enter the fibre bound through the aperture `α`, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant` is this constant times `16 Ctyp²`. It carries
no power of `δ` (§J: the source's `O(1)` rendered at an explicit absolute constant,
never `1`). -/

/-- **The comparison constant of the aligned anisotropic transport at a LATTICE cell.**

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.latticeRescaleConstant bd.C₀` is the constant of the transport attached
to a slab that *is* the normalising ellipsoid about its own `bodyNormal`, at aspect `a/b` and
tangential radius `r₁`. A cell of the refined lattice construction
(GWZ) is none of those three: it is
about a **net** normal `ν`, its tangential radius is `4 r₁` ("tangential widths large
enough to contain `B₁`"; `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_of_four_R`), and its aspect is
therefore `(a/b)/4`. Each departure costs the transport a factor, and all three are `δ`-free:

* the net normal costs `2 ratio` in the alignment
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lineAngle_defining_normal_le_of_axisAngle_le`), so the alignment
  available against `ν` is `2 (a/b) + 2 ratio = (5/2)(a/b) = 10 ratio` — the `10`;
* the transport is the one that normalises the **doubled** cell, so the cell itself lands in
  `B̄(0, 1/2)` and its bodies' `τ₂`-neighbourhoods still land in `B̄(0,1)` — clause (A1′) for
  *every* `Wd`, at radius `1`, with no clause added anywhere.
  Its radius is `8 r₁`, which moves the profile slot to `(8 r₁, 8 b, 4 a)`, and the body meets
  that only at `8 bd.C₀` — the `8 * C₀`;
* clause (A2′) reads the same alignment slot for the *thickened* body, whose extra tilt is
  `≲ C₀² (a/b)` (obligation R7) — the `4 * C₀ ^ 2`.

It carries **no power of `δ`**: this is the source's `O(1)` rendered at an explicit absolute
constant, never `1` and never `δ^{-τ'}`, which is what keeps
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ktRho2EnclosureConstant` `δ`-free and the fullness clause at `L ≤ 5/3`.
The value is a **producer measurement confined to this one line**: if
the C3-b assembly or R7 needs more, this body is re-cut and no statement text moves. -/

/-- **Slab family for `(B, θ)`**.

`𝕊` is a finite set of slabs `S ⊆ B` decomposing the family `𝕎''_B` (here `Wb'`, an arbitrary
`Finset` of body indices — its one instantiation is `ta.sel`, the index set on which the
`c`-refinement `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData` is recorded)
according to the normal direction, at angular resolution `θ`:

* (S2) each slab has affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)`, with the constant `bd.C₀` of
  Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, and **meets** the ball `B`;
* (S3) writing `𝕎''_S = {W ∈ 𝕎''_B : W ⊆ S and ∠(n(W), n(S)) ≤ 2θ}` with `n(·)` the normal of
  blueprint `def:ml2bodyNormal` (`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`, the rank-`2` axis of
  `outerPrism`), the subfamilies `𝕎''_S` partition `𝕎''_B`. This is rendered as: every
  `W ∈ 𝕎''_B` lies in `𝕎''_S` for exactly one `S ∈ 𝕊`, which is precisely
  `𝕎''_B = ⨆_{S ∈ 𝕊} 𝕎''_S`. The angle is read at `2θ` and not at `θ`: GWZ (28), GWZ, define `P_S` through `∠(T_P, T_S) ≤ θ` and add that
  the plane `T_P` "is defined up to accuracy `θ`", so the clause is a `θ`-accuracy statement
  carrying an absolute constant. At constant `1` the Lean clause excluded normals at angle in
  `(1, π/2]` that the source admits; at `2θ` it is void when `θ = 1` (`a = b`), since
  `axisAngle` ranges over `[0, π/2]` and `2 > π/2` — exactly as GWZ's clause is void there;
* (S3′) each body's normal is within `2 (a/b)` of its own slab's normal — the slab's own
  angular width, which is what the anisotropic transport of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` needs and what the refined assignment
  ("the first slab whose normal is closest to its short John axis and whose normal interval
  contains it", GWZ ) gives once
  the net of normals is taken at mesh `κ (a/b)`;
* (S4″) **bounded overlap, cone-restricted**: the slabs whose `C₀ a`-thickening contains a
  given point and whose normal lies within `α` of a given direction number at most
  `slabConeCountConstant(C₀) · (α/(a/b) + 1)²`.

**Why (S1) is gone and (S4) is (S4″).** The GWZ proof's slab cells are *overlapping
lattice slabs* of full tangential extent: "use a fixed net of normals and a lattice only in
the normal coordinate; the two tangential directions are not tiled", each cell
of normal width `Cθ` on a lattice of spacing `cθ`, with "two fixed tangential widths large
enough to contain `B₁`". Consecutive translates therefore overlap in width
`(C − c) θ` and are *parallel*, so the old (S1) (pairwise `IsEssentiallyDistinct`) and the old
(S4) (normals of overlapping slabs `c(C₀) (a/b)`-separated) are both **false** for the family
the source builds. What the source proves instead, and all that its counting uses, is the
`O(1)` label bound at a point: "at a shaded point, the typical-angle property confines all
relevant normals to one `O(θ)`-cap; separation of the normal net and of the one-dimensional
lattice therefore leaves only `O(1)` possible slab labels". That is (S4″), at
the explicit absolute constant `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabConeCountConstant`, restricted to the
cone the consumer reads it in. Its single
consumer, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount`, keeps its statement byte for byte:
under the tangential guard `θ < δ^{-τ'} (a/b)` the factor `(θ/(a/b))²` is below `δ^{-2τ'}`,
which is exactly the shape the count had before. (S1) had **zero** consumers in the tree and
is simply deleted.

Both (S3) and (S3′) are stated through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle`, which since the
correction recorded in its own docstring reads `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal` and not
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyAxis`. The name `axisAngle`, and the names `slabAxisSeparation` and
`slabAxisSeparationConstant`, are retained from before that correction; the direction they
compare is the normal.

The existence of such a family is a maximality argument that the blueprint does *not* prove,
so `𝕊` is carried as data by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` rather than produced
by it; the blueprint statement of `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp` likewise begins "let `𝕊` be a
slab family for `(B, θ)`".

**Why `Set` together with a `Set.Finite` field and not `Finset`.** Every use of `𝕊` in (S3)
and (S4″) treats it as finite, so `Finset` would be the canonical Mathlib type and would remove
the `finite` field — but `ConvexSpaceBody (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))` carries no
`DecidableEq` instance, and none is derivable: a `ConvexSpaceBody` is a set together with
proofs, so equality of two of them is equality of subsets of `ℝ³`, which is not decidable.
Introducing one by `Classical.dec` would make `𝕊` a `Finset` in a noncomputable and
instance-fragile way, and the `Finset` membership `S ∈ 𝕊` occurring in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab.mem` would then depend on that choice of instance. The
`Set` + `Set.Finite` pair is the stable form.

**Why the separation is a clause and not a lemma.** Blueprint `lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation`
presents (S4) as a *consequence* of (S1) and (S2), by the picture "two slabs of thicknesses
`∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)` inside a ball of radius `∼ r₁` whose directions make an angle `≪ a/b`
overlap in more than half of either one, contradicting essential disjointness". That
derivation is false, and not only in the relaxed Lean setting: a ball of radius `r₁` holds
`∼ b/a` disjoint *parallel translates* of one `r₁ × r₁ × (a/b) r₁` box, and translates have
equal normals — and equal axes — so (S1)–(S3) hold — take `Wb' = ∅` to make (S3) vacuous —
while the angle is `0`. Adding a common-point hypothesis does not repair it either: two
coplanar boxes of side `r₁/C₀` inside a ball of radius `r₁` may meet in a single boundary
point with equal normals, since at the comparison constants of (S2) the profile only forces
`τ₀(S), τ₁(S) ∈ [r₁/C₀, C₀ r₁]`.

The counterexamples above are stated for the normal, which is the direction (S4) now compares.
The statement was equally false for the long axis, and for one further reason: two boxes
sharing a long axis and rotated about it by an angle `∼ 1` are essentially disjoint with equal
*axes*, while their *normals* are separated by that rotation. That is one respect in which
the normal is the better-behaved direction here, and part of why it is the one (S4) compares.

What is true is that the family `𝕊` produced by the maximality argument of the blueprint — the
one that bins the bodies of `𝕎''_B` by direction at resolution `θ ≥ a/b` — has separated
normals by construction. Since the re-cut of (S4) to (S4″) the
projection is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabConeCount`, so that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` still names its input.

**A deliberate divergence: "slab" is relaxed to a thickness profile.** Blueprint
`hyp:ml2tangentialSlabFamily` asks for a finite family of *slabs* in the sense of
`def:slab`, whose Lean forms are `Kakeya.Slab` of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Slab/Basic.lean` and
`Kakeya.Prism3D` of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Prism.lean`. Those types pin the shape of `S`
exactly — a `Prism3D` *is* an axis-aligned box of prescribed half-widths — whereas every use the
tangential argument makes of a slab (its three thicknesses, its normal
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`, its containment in `B`) is a comparison up to the constant
`bd.C₀` of (C3)/(C4). So (S2) is stated as
`HasThicknesses S.carrier bd.C₀ ![r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁]`, the same thickness-profile idiom the
rest of this development uses, and `S` is an arbitrary `ConvexSpaceBody`.

The relaxation is strict: a `HasThicknesses` body need not be a slab, so (S1)–(S3) are
*weaker* than the blueprint's. With the separation moved into (S4) this no longer makes any
statement of this file refutable — a weaker hypothesis only weakens the lemmas that consume it
— but it does leave a satisfiability obligation on whoever eventually constructs `𝕊`: the
family must consist of bodies for which (S3) and (S4) both hold, the two clauses jointly
constraining the one direction `n(S)` that both read.

Since the correction to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle` that obligation is *lighter* than it
was. For a profile `∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)` the two long thicknesses are comparable, so the
rank-`0` direction that `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyAxis` reads off `outerPrism` is not pinned by the
geometry of `S` at all — the outer prism selects one frame out of a circle of admissible ones
— and the old reading of (S3)/(S4) constrained a direction the hypotheses did not determine.
The short thickness, by contrast, is separated from the two long ones as soon as
`C₀² (a/b) < 1`, so the rank-`2` direction `n(S)` that `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal` reads off
*is* constrained by the geometry of `S`, to the extent of that gap. What remains owed is only
that the directions so constrained satisfy (S3) and (S4). Restoring
`Kakeya.Slab`/`Kakeya.Prism3D` in (S2), or carrying the normal of each slab as data alongside

  `B`, rather than lying inside it.

  The refined construction gives the slab cells "two fixed tangential widths large enough to
  contain `B₁`" (GWZ), so a cell is not
  contained in `B̄(ctr B, r₁)` — nor in any fixed multiple of it. What is true, and what the
  assignment gives, is that a retained cell carries at least one plank of the ball, hence
  meets the ball. This is the weakest positional clause the source supports, and it is what
  the family needs to be *about* `B` at all.

  The clause it replaces was `S.carrier ⊆ Metric.closedBall (bd.ctr B) (cfg.r₁ : ℝ)`, and that
  containment is **compiler-refuted for any family with translates**: for a normalising
  ellipsoid `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.center_eq_of_generalSlab_subset_closedBall` shows the
  containment at radius `r₁` forces the slab's centre to be `bd.ctr B`, so the family is
  concentric and admits none of the "`∼ b/a` parallel translates per direction" the source's
  lattice produces. Weakening it to `2 r₁` buys translates but keeps
  a containment the source does not have; the intersection form drops it altogether. Clause
  (A1) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` — the only consumer of the old
  containment — is correspondingly re-read on the *bodies*, which are inside the ball by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_subset_ball`. -/

  normal angle at `2θ` — GWZ's "up to accuracy `θ`" with an absolute constant. The fibres `𝕎''_S = slabOf⁻¹(S)` then partition `𝕎''_B` by construction,
  which is GWZ's `𝕎''_B = ⊔_S 𝕎''_S` read as an assignment: the filter sets of (28)
  need not be literally disjoint for a maximal essentially distinct family, so the earlier
  `∃!` was a strictly stronger demand than the source makes. -/

  /-- (S3′) each body of `𝕎''_B` has its normal within `2 (a/b)` of the normal of **its own
  slab** — the slab's own angular width, not the typical angle `θ`.

  This is what makes GWZ's "converts `𝕎''_S` to a set `𝕋̃` of `ρ₂`-tubes" (GWZ) true: the anisotropic transport stretches the slab normal by `b/(a r₁)` and the
  plane by `1/r₁`, so a tilt of `s` costs a factor `1 + s b/a` in the rank-`1` thickness of the
  image (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickness_one_aniRescale_image_le_of_aligned`), which is
  `δ`-free exactly when `s ≲ a/b`. At `θ ≤ δ^{-τ'} (a/b)` — the tangential guard — clause (S3)
  is weaker by exactly `δ^{-τ'}` (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tilt_gap_is_delta_pow_tau'`). At
  `a = b` the two clauses coincide (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.typicalAngle_eq_one_of_a_eq_b`), so
  the degenerate route pays nothing.

  It is **produced, not assumed**, by the refined assignment: the normal net has mesh
  `κ (a/b)` and a plank is assigned to "the first slab whose normal is closest to its short
  John axis and whose normal interval contains it"
  (GWZ). The sub-class count that
  the finer mesh costs is `(δ^{-τ'}/κ)²`, which is the existing
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant` with `κ^{-2}` absorbed — a `δ`-free constant,
  since `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabDecompMultConstant` is a predicate on `Cμ`. -/

  width `Cθ`, so a point lies in `⌈C/c⌉+1` slabs per net normal): the slabs whose
  `C₀ a`-thickening contains `x` and whose normal lies within `α` of `v` number at most a
  `δ`-free constant times the number of net cells in the `α`-cone at resolution `a/b`.
  Consumed by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` at `α = 3 Ctyp θ`; replaces
  (S4′), which is false for parallel lattice translates.

  **Why the count is cone-restricted and not over the whole family**. The refined normal net is "a fixed `cθ`-net of
  unoriented normal directions" over *all* directions
  (GWZ), so at mesh `κ (a/b)` a
  point lies in `≍ (b/a)²/κ²` slabs — one `O(1)` lattice layer per direction — and `b/a` is up
  to `δ^{-(1-exscal)}`, not `δ^{-O(τ')}`. An unrestricted count at a `δ`-free constant times
  `(θ/(a/b))²` is therefore **false for the family the source builds**. What is true, and all
  the source's counting uses, is the count *inside the cone* the typical-angle property
  confines the relevant normals to: "at a shaded point, the typical-angle property confines
  all relevant normals to one `O(θ)`-cap; separation of the normal net and of the
  one-dimensional lattice therefore leaves only `O(1)` possible slab labels".
  The sole consumer, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount`, reads it at exactly that
  cone — `α = 3 Ctyp θ` about the normal of a body shading `x`, which is what
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle` supplies — so the restriction costs the
  consumer nothing and is what makes the clause satisfiable by the lattice family.

  **The radius of the thickening.** It is `C₀ a`, the same one (S4′) carried, and for the same
  reason: a shaded point of a body of `𝕎''_S` lies in `N_{τ₂(W)}(W)` by
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening`, and `τ₂(W) ≤ C₀ a` by (C4)
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_thickness`, so this is exactly the radius the single
  consumer's call site can manufacture.

  **The shape of the bound.** `(α/(a/b) + 1)²` and not `(α/(a/b))²`: the count of net cells in
  a cone of aperture `α` at resolution `a/b` is `≍ (α/(a/b) + 1)²`, and the `+1` is what keeps
  the clause true at apertures below the mesh — in particular at `α = 0`, where one slab may
  still contain `x`. `Set.ncard` because the counted object is a `Set` of slabs, matching the
  conclusion of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount`. -/

/-- **A dense slab of the family `𝕊`, with its subfamily `𝕎''_S`** (blueprint
`tangentialSdens`, the output of `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp`).

`S` is one of the slabs of the family `𝕊` for `(B, ta.θ)`, and `Wd` indexes the subfamily
`𝕎''_S = {W ∈ 𝕎''_B : W ⊆ S and ∠(n(W), n(S)) ≤ 2θ}` of blueprint `tangentialWWS`, with `n(·)`
the normal of blueprint `def:ml2bodyNormal` (`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`). The eight
clauses are exactly what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` returns about the pair
`(S, Wd)` and exactly what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` consumes about it; they
are bundled because the rescaling hypothesis of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`
has to be quantified over *precisely* the pairs `(S, Wd)` the decomposition can produce, and
listing them one by one there had already dropped the angle clause, which made that
hypothesis unsatisfiable.

**The index set is `ta.sel`, not `𝕎'_B.**` Blueprint `hyp:ml2tangentialSlabFamily`(S3)
decomposes the `c`-refinement `𝕎''_B`, and the Lean record of that refinement,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData`, carries it on `ta.sel` only: `ta.hrefine`,
`ta.htyp`, `ta.hfull` and `ta.hconst` all live there, and `ta.YW` carries no information
whatsoever off `ta.sel`. With `subset : Wd ⊆ (tc.thinBall hB).bodies'` the two conclusions of
`tangentialSlabDecomp`, both stated about `ta.YW` on `Wd`, would therefore say nothing about
the factoring bodies, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` would be *false*: taking
all `ta.YW j` to be one and the same fully shaded body makes `λ(Wd, ta.YW) = 1` while
`μ(Wd, ta.YW) = |Wd|`, which (A3) bounds only by `≈ δ^{-3ϱ} ρ₂^{-2}`. With `Wd ⊆ ta.sel`,
`ta.hrefine` pins `(ta.YW j).toConvexSpaceBody` to the outer body
`((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody`, which the enlargement sandwich
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` / `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening` in turn pins
between the geometric body `bd.Wb j` and its closed `τ₂(bd.Wb j)`-neighbourhood; the
counterexample disappears. It is *not* pinned to `bd.Wb j` itself — the corrected factoring
proposition returns genuine enlargements — but the sandwich is two-sided and tight at the
scale of the body, so every geometric clause below still bears on the shaded family, with the
one-factor-of-`2` losses recorded at their use.

The angle clause is what makes the anisotropic rescaling of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` turn the bodies of `𝕎''_S` into `ρ₂`-tubes: a
body of thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` sitting in a slab of thicknesses `∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)`
with its *thin* direction at angle up to `π/2` from `n(S)` is *not* carried to a tube by the
map that stretches the short axis of `S` by `∼ b/a`. Without the clause, (A2) fails and the
hypothesis is vacuous. Note that this is exactly what the clause says now that it is read on
the normals: `∠(n(W), n(S)) ≤ 2θ` says the thin direction of `W` is that of `S` up to `2θ`
(the `θ`-accuracy of GWZ (28) with an absolute constant, at `θ = 1`,
i.e. `a = b`, the clause is void, as GWZ's is), which is the alignment the stretch needs. On
the old reading, `∠(v(W), v(S)) ≤ θ`, it said instead that the two *long* directions agree,
which in `ℝ³` leaves the thin direction of `W` free to rotate about `v(S)` and does not give
(A2).

The density clause `dense` is what makes the name honest, and it is why the conclusion of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` is a two-fold and not a three-fold conjunction: it
is blueprint `tangentialDensityChain`,
`δ^{8η} ≤ tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C · λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`, consumed at exactly one
place, blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabFull`. Both corrections against the earlier
`δ^{3η} ≤ tc.C · λ` are forced: the exponent is `8η` because the chain has *two* independent
factors, `δ^{6η}` from (T2) at the `tb` index `2η` (F8) and `δ^{2η}` from `ta.hc`, and the
constant is `100 · tc.C` because the slab selection of blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialDenseSlabs` keeps only the slabs of density at least a hundredth of
`λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`. Being a constant and not a power of `δ` it is carried by name and
discharged where the clause is consumed, by `SlabMultKT.densityConstant`. -/

/-- **The anisotropic slab rescaling** (blueprint `hyp:ml2anisotropicSlabRescale`, together
with the `Δ_max` transport of blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialDeltamaxTransport`).

`L` is the linear change of variables carrying the slab `S` to the unit ball: it rescales the
two axes of length `∼ r₁` to unit length and stretches the short axis, of length
`∼ (a/b) r₁`, by `∼ b/a`. The blueprint has the isotropic homothety toolkit but not the
anisotropic comparison, so its three effects are *assumed*:

* (A1) `L(S) ⊆ B₁`, whence also `L(W) ⊆ B₁` for every `W ∈ 𝕎''_S`, since `W ⊆ S`;
* (A1') `L(N_{τ₂(W)}(W)) ⊆ B₁` for every `W ∈ 𝕎''_S`, where `N_r` is the closed
  `r`-neighbourhood and `τ₂(W) = W.scale` is the shortest affine thickness of `W`;
* (A2) `L(W)` is a `ρ₂`-tube up to the thickness constant `bd.C₀`, for every `W ∈ 𝕎''_S`;
* (A2') `L(N_{τ₂(W)}(W))` is a `ρ₂`-tube up to the *doubled* constant `2 bd.C₀`;
* (A3) the transport distorts `Δ_max` by at most `CΔ`: any realisation of the image family
  `L(𝕎''_S)` as convex bodies is Katz–Tao at `CΔ δ^{-2ϱ}`.

**Why the two primed clauses.** The family that carries the shading is not `bd.Wb` but the
outer family `𝕎'_B` of the corrected factoring proposition, whose bodies
`((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody` are genuine *enlargements* of the geometric bodies:
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` and `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening` pin them
between `bd.Wb j` and `N_{τ₂(bd.Wb j)}(bd.Wb j)` and nothing more. An enlarged carrier need
not lie in the slab `S` at all, so (A1) says nothing about it, and thicknesses are not
monotone, so neither does (A2). The primed clauses are the same two assertions made about the
*outer* end of that sandwich, which is a set built from `bd.Wb` alone; squeezing gives both
assertions for the enlarged carriers, at the cost of the factor `2` in the thickness constant.
That factor is exactly the one `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W` charges in the
original coordinates, and it is the same loss the slab case absorbs into
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputsConstant`; it is charged here to
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData`, which is stated at comparison constant `2 bd.C₀`.

Neither primed clause is a new geometric demand on `L`: a map normalising `S` to the unit ball
carries `N_{τ₂(W)}(W)` — a set of affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)`, by
`ConvexSpaceBody.hasThicknesses_cthickening`, and contained in `N_{τ₂(W)}(S)` — to a body of
thicknesses `∼ (1, ρ₂, ρ₂)` inside a fixed multiple of `B₁`, exactly as it does `W` itself.
The geometric clauses (A1)–(A3) are kept unprimed and unchanged: they are what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` reads, and that lemma counts the *index set* `Wd` and is
therefore free to do so against the geometric bodies.

Clause (A3) is blueprint `tangentialDeltamaxTransport`, and it is what gives the parameter
`CΔ` content: without it `CΔ` would occur only in its own threshold
`tangentialDeltamaxThreshold` and could be taken to be `1`. Its bound `CΔ δ^{-2ϱ}` is the
product of the three factors of blueprint `def:ml2tangentialSlabDeltamaxConstant` — the `⪅`
constant of `factmaxmod2` at bias `ϱ`, the distortion of the transport itself, and the square
of the absolute constant of `def:tubeCountFromDeltamaxConstant` — against the biased maximal
density `Δ_max(𝕎''_S) ≤ Δ_max(𝕎_B)` that Lemma 9.2 (`lemmafactmaxbias`) supplies per ball.
GWZ (83) at `U = B` reads `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ≲ (|W|/|B|)^{-ϱ}` with `|W|/|B| ∼ ab/r₁² ≥ (δ/r₁)²`,
so the supply is `(δ/r₁)^{-2ϱ} = δ^{-2ϱ(1-exscal)}` up to a `δ`-free constant — strictly
above `δ^{-ϱ}` whenever `exscal < 1/2` (`CaseParams.scale`) and at most `δ^{-2ϱ}`. It is what
clause (C4), `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering`, records as
`Cbias δ^{-2ϱ}`, and it reaches `L(𝕎''_S)` unchanged, `Δ_max` being monotone in the family
and invariant under affine equivalences. A budget of `CΔ δ^{-ϱ}` for (A3)
would require `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ⪅ δ^{-ϱ}`, which does not follow from (83) for
`BallData` produced by Lemma 9.2 (its constant is `≥ 2`); the estimate therefore uses the exponent `2ϱ` and the half-exponent threshold `SlabPackage.CΔ_le` to `CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}`, so that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` still close at
`δ^{-3ϱ}`. Being a constant and not a power of `δ`, `CΔ` is discharged by the fixed-scale
threshold `SlabPackage.CΔ_le` and never by the exponent budget.

(A3) is stated by quantifying over the realisations `V` of `L(𝕎''_S)` as a family of convex
bodies rather than by naming one, because `ConvexSpaceBody` carries convexity, compactness and
interior data that the image of an affine equivalence does not come with for free in Lean;
`Δ_max` depends on `V` only through the carriers, which the hypothesis pins down. -/

  the *bodies*, which lie in the ball `B` by

  only through `Set.image_mono` composed with `IsDenseSlab.bodies_subset`, i.e. only at the

  **Why the constant is a parameter.** On the degenerate route `a = b` the transport is a
  homothety and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_degenerateRescale_body` gives the clause at
  `bd.C₀` itself; at general `(a, b)` it is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.latticeRescaleConstant bd.C₀`
  that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_slabRescale_body_of_denseSlab` delivers, and at
  `bd.C₀` alone the clause is **not** a consequence of the transport at any `a < b`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aniLin_rank_two_gap`). Pinning either value here would either break the
  degenerate tripwire or make the general route unprovable, so the value travels with the
  structure as the parameter `Cmp`, pinned by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage.rescale` (with
  `bd.C₀ ≤ Cmp`) and matched against the comparison constant of the Katz–Tao input, pinned by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT.estimate`, at the single place both are read,
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`.  (Neither is a *field*: carrying the constant as a
  field of `SlabPackage` is undischargeable, because conjunct 3 of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SideDataObligations` hands over `Nonempty (SlabPackage cfg ta)` and the
  consumer takes `.some`, so the package's constant is opaque exactly where the two must be
  compared.)

  At the general route's value the constant is a polynomial in `bd.C₀` and carries **no power of
  `δ`**: that is the
  difference from `anisotropicRescaleConstant bd.C₀ cfg.δ τ' = 4 C₀ δ^{-τ'}`, and it is why the
  enclosure constant `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ktRho2EnclosureConstant` stays `δ`-free and the
  fullness clause stays at `L ≤ 5/3`. It is produced from clause (S3′)/`IsDenseSlab.angle_ratio`

`cfg.KTRho2ScaleData bd ε η₁ κ` is the cross-section of GWZ Lemma 3.7
(`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound_generalize`, blueprint `genKKT`) at loss `ε`,
fullness threshold `η₁`, `Δ_max` level `κ`, tube scale `ρ₂` and Katz–Tao parameter
`τ = δ ≤ ρ₂`: any finite family of bodies comparable to `ρ₂`-tubes in the unit ball which is
Katz–Tao at `δ^{-κ}` and `δ^{η₁}`-full has multiplicity at most `δ^{-ε} |𝕋|^β`. The two
exponents are kept apart because the source keeps them apart: in Lemma 3.7 `Δ_max` enters as
the *factor* `Δ_max^{1-β}`, which the consumer folds into the loss `ε` at its own `Δ_max`
level `δ^{-κ}`, and the only threshold Lemma 3.7 attaches to the pair `(ε, β)` is the fullness
one, `η₁ = η(ε, β)`. The earlier diagonal `κ = η₁` — Definition 3.4's shape, with the `Δ_max`
level pinned to the fullness threshold — was refuted by the constant-copies family: `D` copies
of one fully shaded body satisfy every hypothesis at `D ≈ δ^{-η₁}` and violate the conclusion
as `δ → 0` once `ε < η₁ (1-β)`.

It differs from `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTScaleData` in all three respects that the tangential
case needs, and neither implies the other: `KTScaleData` speaks only about subfamilies of the
fixed family `cfg.T` of `δ`-tubes, at the fixed threshold exponent `cfg.η`, whereas the
rescaled family `𝕋̃ = L(𝕎''_S)` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` consists of
`ρ₂`-tubes indexed by a subset of `bd.ω`, and its fullness is only `δ^{8η}`. Reading the
estimate at the small parameter `τ = δ` for a family of `ρ₂`-tubes is exactly the content of
Remark `multBoundsDeltaVsRho`, and it only weakens the fullness requirement, since `τ ≤ ρ₂`
gives `τ^{η₁} ≤ ρ₂^{η₁}`.

The fullness threshold `η₁` is left as a parameter, since it is what
`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound_generalize` produces existentially from the pair
`(ε, β)`; the `Δ_max` level `κ` is a parameter because it is what the consumer supplies (for
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` it is the `δ^{-3ϱ}` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao`); the hypothesis `9η ≤ η₁` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT` is what connects `η₁` to the density chain. No clause
relates `κ` to `η₁`: `η₁(ε, β) ≤ ε/(1-β)` for every threshold `K_KT(β)` can provide, so a
clause `κ ≤ η₁` at `κ = 3ϱ`, `ε = ϱ` would be unsatisfiable for `β < 2/3`.

**Why the family consists of `ShadedBody`.** A hypothesis
`T : ω → ShadedTube cfg.rho2 (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))` would not apply
to the family used by the consumer. `Tube ρ` carries the field
`carrier_eq : carrier = ⋃ z ∈ segment x y, closedBall z ρ`, which structurally forces the
carrier to be the `ρ`-thickening of a unit segment. What
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` supplies about the rescaled bodies is its
clause (A2), `HasThicknesses (L '' (bd.Wb j).carrier) bd.C₀ ![1, rho2, rho2]` — thicknesses
*comparable* to that profile, with constant `bd.C₀`. Comparable is not equal: a
`1 × rho2 × rho2` box has exactly that thickness profile and is not the `rho2`-thickening of
any unit segment, and no lemma turns a `HasThicknesses ![1, ρ, ρ]` convex body into a `Tube ρ`
with the *same* carrier. Since clause (A3) gives its Katz–Tao bound only for families whose
carriers *equal* `L '' (bd.Wb j).carrier`, there was no way to build a `ShadedTube` family
meeting the Katz–Tao hypothesis, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` was blocked
outright rather than merely unproved.

The statement never used the tube-only fields — only `.carrier`, `.shade`,
`.toConvexSpaceBody`, all of which `ShadedBody` has — so the repair is to quantify over
`ShadedBody` and carry the tube profile as the explicit hypothesis `hthick`. That is also the
faithful rendering of Remark `multBoundsDeltaVsRho`, which reads the Katz–Tao estimate for a
family of bodies comparable to `ρ₂`-tubes; the enclosure implicit in "comparable" costs a
constant, which is what `bd.C₀` records. The comparison constant is `2 bd.C₀`, so `bd` is now a
parameter of the definition.

**Why `2 bd.C₀` and not `bd.C₀`.** The family the estimate is applied to is the rescaled
*shaded* family `𝕋̃ = L(𝕎''_S)`, whose carriers are the enlarged outer carriers
`((tc.thinBall hB).W j).carrier` of the corrected factoring proposition and not the geometric
bodies `bd.Wb j`. Those carriers inherit the tube profile only at the doubled constant — that
is clause (A2') of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale`, and in the original
coordinates it is `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.hasThicknesses_W`. Reading the estimate at `2 bd.C₀`
is a *strengthening* of this assumption, not of any conclusion: a Katz–Tao estimate valid for
bodies comparable to `ρ₂`-tubes with a worse constant is what the tangential chain needs, and
`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.generalize` supplies it at every fixed comparison constant. The slab
case charges the same doubling, there through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabInputsConstant`.

The family is indexed by `bd.ω` and not by a universe-quantified `ω : Type u`: the sole
instantiation is at `bd.ω` (through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`, whose family
`𝕋̃ = L(𝕎''_S)` is indexed by `Wd ⊆ bd.ω`), and `BallData.ω : Type u` already lives at the
universe of `cfg`, so the polymorphism was never exercised. -/

/-! ### Invariance of `μ` and `λ` under the anisotropic rescaling

Blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabRescale`, equation `tangentialSlabRescaleInvariance`, is
`ShadedBody.multiplicity_affineImage` and `ShadedBody.fullness_affineImage` of
`Kakeya/Homothety.lean`: two statements, one conclusion each, in the `ShadedBody` namespace
beside their isotropic special cases `ShadedBody.multiplicity_homothety` and
`ShadedBody.fullness_homothety`, and stated for a general finite-dimensional real inner
product space rather than for `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`. Nothing about them is specific to
the very-not-sticky case, so they do not live here.

/-- **The fibre-count constant** `C^fib_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp}` of blueprint
`def:ml2tangentialSlabDecompMultConstant`(a).

The product of the constant implicit in the `⪅` of the typicality bound `anglebound`, which is
`Ctyp`, with the absolute constant of the covering argument counting the slabs met by one
fibre. The proof of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` produces it as
`C_{lem:coneDirectionCount} (3 Ctyp / c_{lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation}(C₀))²`, the aperture of
the cone being `3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} a/b` and the separation of its normals
`c_{lem:ml2slabAxisSeparation}(C₀) a/b`, so that the scale `a/b` cancels.

The factor `3 Ctyp` — rather than the `2 + Ctyp` that the triangle inequality
`∠(n(S), n(W₁)) ≤ ∠(n(S), n(W)) + ∠(n(W), n(W₁)) ≤ 2θ + Ctyp θ` literally gives — is the
blueprint's `2 Ctyp` with the slab-angle clause read at `2θ` instead of `θ` (clause (S3) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` and the filter
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodies` bound `∠(n(W), n(S))` by `2θ`, GWZ's `θ`-accuracy with an
absolute constant; the factor `2` is absorbed here), and it is legitimate only because
`1 ≤ Ctyp`. That is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hCtyp1`, a field of the typical-angle bundle and not
something the shape of this constant can supply: the expression is `∝ Ctyp²`, so at small
`Ctyp` it *decreases*, and at `Ctyp = 0` it vanishes while the count is `≥ 1` as soon as one
slab shades `x`.

It carries no power of `δ`: the `δ^{-2τ'}` of the fibre count is written out in the statement
and charged to the quarter budget. Together with the factor `100/99` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialDenseSlabs_isCRefinement` this is exactly what an admissible
`Cμ` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabDecompMultConstant` dominates. -/

  slabConeCountConstant C₀ * 16 * Ctyp ^ 2


/-- **Constant in the multiplicity clause of `tangentialSlabDecomp`**.

`Cμ` is *admissible for the thickness constant `C₀` and the typicality constant `Ctyp`* if it
dominates the product of the two multiplicative losses of the multiplicity chain: the
fibre-count constant `C^fib_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp}` of blueprint
`def:ml2tangentialSlabDecompMultConstant`(a), which is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant`, and the factor `100/99` of
`def:ml2tangentialSlabDecompMultConstant`(b) coming from the passage to the dense subfamily.

Like blueprint `def:ml2goalDensity`, this is a *predicate* on a constant and not a defining
equation: `Cμ` also has to satisfy the fixed-scale threshold `Cμ ≤ δ^{-τ'}` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage.Cμ_le`, so it cannot be pinned to a formula. The single
clause is exactly the inequality the proof of `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp` needs in order to
absorb the prefactor `(100/99) C^fib δ^{-2τ' - 2η}` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecompMultChain` into `δ^{-C_sep τ'/4}`. There is no
separate `1 ≤ Cμ` field: at the constants the consumers use,
`slabDecompFibreConstant bd.C₀ ta.Ctyp = 9 · 2^34 bd.C₀^8 ta.Ctyp^2`, and both `1 ≤ bd.C₀` and
`1 ≤ ta.Ctyp` are available — the latter as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hCtyp1`, a field of the typical-angle bundle — so the
fibre constant is `≥ 9 · 2^34` and `1 ≤ Cμ` follows from `typ_le`.

What matters, and all that the consumers use, is that an admissible `Cμ` is a function of
`Ctyp`, of `bd.C₀` and of absolute constants alone, and carries no power of `δ`: every power
of `δ` in the multiplicity clause — the `δ^{-2τ'}` of the fibre count and the `δ^{-2η}` of
the refinement — is written out in the statement instead. That is exactly what makes the
fixed-scale threshold `tangentialSlabMultThreshold`, `Cμ ≤ δ^{-τ'}`, available. -/

/-! ### The slab decomposition, in pieces

The decomposition `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` is a chain of independent
moves, each stated separately here: naming the subfamily `𝕎''_S` of a slab and the subfamily
attached to a *set* of slabs, recasting the latter as a refinement, selecting the dense slabs,
separating the slab normals, counting the slabs met by one fibre, and chaining the density and
the multiplicity. The exponent check is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecompExponent`, in `MainLemma2/VeryNotSticky.lean`, and
the positivity side conditions are the `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinBallPositivity_*` group, in
`MainLemma2/ThinConfig.lean`; neither mentions a slab, so neither lives here.

For a subfamily `𝕊' ⊆ 𝕊` of a slab family, summing a weight `f` first over the bodies of each

/-- **The dense slabs**.

`𝕊_dens` is the set of slabs of `𝕊` whose subfamily `𝕎''_S` is nonempty and carries at least a
hundredth of the ambient density `λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`. The density condition is stated
division-free, as `λ(𝕎''_B, Y) ∑_{W ∈ 𝕎''_S}|W| ≤ 100 ∑_{W ∈ 𝕎''_S}|Y(W)|`: in the quotient
form it needs `∑_{W ∈ 𝕎''_S}|W| > 0`, which `𝕎''_S ≠ ∅` alone does not give — that comes from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.volume_body_pos`.

The threshold is the explicit number `1/100` and not a `⪆ 1`: the multiplicity chain divides
by it, and `Kakeya.LEApprox` supplies its constant only existentially. The clause
`𝕎''_S ≠ ∅` is part of the definition and not an afterthought, since
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` asserts the existence of a slab with `𝕎''_S ≠ ∅`
and takes a maximum of `μ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})` over `𝕊_dens`. -/

/-- **The packing step of blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabFibreCount`, re-proved from the
cone-restricted (S4″).**

Any finite set `F` of slabs of the family, each of whose subfamilies shades the point `x`, has
at most `C^fib δ^{-2τ'}` elements.

**The route changed with the re-cut and the statement did not.** Before, the bound came from a
packing argument: clause (S4′) separated the normals of the slabs of `F` and
`Kakeya.NonSlab.card_le_coneDirectionCount` counted them inside the cone of aperture
`3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} (a/b)` that typicality confines them to. GWZ's slab cells are
lattice translates and have no such separation, so (S4′) is gone; what it now reads is (S4″),
which *is* the count, at the `δ`-free `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabConeCountConstant`. Both
geometric steps that fed the packing argument survive unchanged, and they are exactly the two
hypotheses (S4″) takes: the shaded point `x` of a body of `𝕎''_S` lies in the `C₀ a`-thickening
of `S`, and the normal of `S` lies in the cone of aperture `α = 3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} (a/b)` about the
normal of the body `W₁ = bd.Wb j₁` shading `x` (`tangentialFibre_cap'`, unchanged). **That
second step is why the licensed clause is cone-restricted and the whole-family form is not
needed**: the consumer never counts slabs outside the cone.

The arithmetic is then: `F` injects into
`{S ∈ 𝕊 : x ∈ N_{C₀ a}(S) ∧ ∠(n(S), n(W₁)) ≤ α}`, (S4″) bounds that set's `ncard` by
`slabConeCountConstant(C₀) (α/(a/b) + 1)²`, the scale `a/b` cancels inside the clause
(`α/(a/b) = 3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'}`), and `1 ≤ Ctyp δ^{-τ'}` — from `ta.hCtyp1` and the tangential
guard through `tangentialFibre_scales` — turns `(3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} + 1)²` into
`16 Ctyp² δ^{-2τ'}`, which is `slabDecompFibreConstant bd.C₀ ta.Ctyp · δ^{-2τ'}` by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant_eq`. -/

/-- **One fibre meets few slabs**.

In the tangential case `θ < δ^{-τ'} a/b`, typicality of `θ` bounds the angle between the
*normals* of any two bodies of `𝕎''_B` sharing a shaded point by `Ctyp θ` (the field
`ta.hangle`), so the normals of the slabs of `𝕊'` whose subfamily shades a fixed point `x` all
lie in a cone of aperture `3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} a/b` about the normal of any one body shading `x`.
Since the re-cut of (S4) to (S4″) the count is read off the clause itself
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabConeCount`): at the shaded point `x` the slabs whose subfamily
shades `x` all contain `x` in their `C₀ a`-thickenings *and* have their normals in the cone of
aperture `α = 3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} (a/b)` about `n(W₁)`, and (S4″) bounds how many of those there are
by `slabConeCountConstant(C₀) (α/(a/b) + 1)² ≤ C^fib δ^{-2τ'}`, the scale `a/b` cancelling.

Typicality travels in the bundle `ta`, through `ta.htyp` and `ta.Ctyp`, exactly as in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`; the blueprint states it as "`θ` is a typical
angle for `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` with constant `C_{lem:ml2typicalangle}`, as produced by
Proposition `lem:ml2typicalangle`", which is what that bundle is.

**The signature.** Fourteen binder groups is above the usual threshold, so here is one line
per group, saying what the statement loses without it. The first five are the ambient data
that fix the meaning of every symbol on both sides and are all inferable from later
arguments: `cfg` is Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, carrying `δ`, `a`, `b` and `r₁`; `τ'` is
the exponent of the tangential threshold, appearing in `htang` and in the conclusion; `bd` is
the per-ball data of `hyp:ml2setup`, carrying the index type `bd.ω`, the bodies `bd.Wb` and
the thickness constant `bd.C₀` of the conclusion; `tc` is the thin-case configuration, needed
only to type `ta`; `B` is the ball. Then: `hB` is `B ∈ 𝔅`, without which `tc.thinBall` — and
hence `ta` — has nothing to be about. `ta` is the typical-angle bundle, and it is what
supplies *four* separate ingredients of the statement, which is why it is a bundle and not
four binders: the index set `ta.sel = 𝕎''_B`, the shading `ta.YW`, the angle `ta.θ` and its
typicality constant `ta.Ctyp`; without typicality (`ta.htyp`) the cone in the proof has no
aperture bound and the conclusion is false. `𝕊` and `hS` are the slab family: `hS` supplies
(S4″), the cone-restricted point count, which `slabConeCount` names, and (S2), which fixes
their scale `a/b`; without them the slabs counted are arbitrary convex bodies and no bound
holds. `htang` is the tangential case hypothesis, `θ < δ^{-τ'} a/b`; without it the cone has
aperture `Ctyp θ` with `θ` unbounded and the count is not `δ^{-2τ'}`. `𝕊'` and `h𝕊'` are the
subfamily being counted and its inclusion in `𝕊`; `h𝕊'` is what makes `hS` apply to `𝕊'`, and
hence what makes the counted set finite. Finally `x` and `hx` are the fibre point: `hx` puts
`x` in the shaded union, which is what produces the body `W₁` whose normal is the axis of the
cone, and it is also the only route by which `ta.hCtyp1` — the lower bound `1 ≤ Ctyp` that the
aperture step `2θ + Ctyp θ ≤ 3 Ctyp θ` needs — becomes relevant; it is what the consumer
`tangentialSlabFibreCountMult` has available, `x` ranging over the domain of integration
`E = U(𝕍_{𝕊'}, Y)`.

The count is `Set.ncard`, Mathlib's cardinality of a set, and not the `card` of a `Finset`
built from `hS.finite.subset h𝕊'`: the blueprint counts
`#{S ∈ 𝕊' : x ∈ U(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})}`, a set, and phrasing the conclusion through
`Set.Finite.toFinset` would make it depend on the proof term `hS`. Finiteness is not lost —
`hS.finite.subset h𝕊'` still supplies it inside the proof — and `Set.ncard` of a finite set is
its cardinality. -/

/-- **From the fibre count to a multiplicity bound**.

Applying `MeasureTheory.sum_measure_inter_eq_setLIntegral_card` to the shaded unions
`U(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`, `S ∈ 𝕊'`, over `E = U(𝕍_{𝕊'}, Y)` turns the pointwise bound
`tangentialFibreSlabCount` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` into
`μ(𝕍_{𝕊'}, Y) ≤ C^fib δ^{-2τ'} max_{S ∈ 𝕊'} μ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`.

The maximum is rendered existentially, as a slab realising it: `𝕊'` is finite and, since
`𝕍_{𝕊'} ≠ ∅`, has a slab with nonempty subfamily, so the two forms agree, and the existential
is what the one consumer, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecompMultChain`, uses. The two
positivity hypotheses are not decoration: without `hne` the maximum is over an empty set, and
without `hU` the final division is illegitimate.

**The signature.** It is that of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` with the
fibre point `(x, hx)` — which is integrated out — replaced by the two positivity hypotheses
`hne` and `hU`, so the account of the first twelve groups given in that docstring applies
verbatim: `cfg`, `τ'`, `bd`, `tc`, `B` are the ambient data, `hB` places `B` in `𝔅`, `ta`
bundles `𝕎''_B = ta.sel`, its shading `ta.YW`, the angle `ta.θ` and the typicality constant
`ta.Ctyp`, `𝕊`/`hS` are the slab family with (S1)–(S3), `htang` is the tangential case
hypothesis, and `𝕊'`/`h𝕊'` are the subfamily and its inclusion. The last two are as described
above. -/

/-- **The density chain at a dense slab**.

`δ^{8η} ≤ C_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp} λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})` for every dense slab `S`, with
`C_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecomp} = 100 tc.C` the constant
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecompConstant`. This is the `dense` field of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab`, and it is the density clause of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`.

Four inequalities chain: `δ^{2η} ≤ c` (`ta.hc`, blueprint `tangentialRefinementFactor`),
`δ^{6η} ≤ tc.C λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` ((T2), `ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies` at the `tb` index
`2η`),
`c λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`
(`ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.mul_fullness_le`, blueprint `lem:ml2fullnessRefine`), and
`λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B}) ≤ 100 λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialDenseSlabs_fullness_le`).

The exponent is `8η`: the two factors — the `δ^{6η}` of (T2) at the `tb` index `2η` (F8) and
the `δ^{2η}` of the refinement — are independent and neither can be dropped, and the blueprint
gives a counterexample to the `2η` form.

No slab-family *hypothesis* is a binder: no link of the chain reads
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`, in particular not its partition clause (S3), and the
only thing `hSd` is used for is the pair of clauses `(slabBodies … S).Nonempty` and the
division-free density inequality of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.denseSlabs`. The family `𝕊` itself
is still an (implicit) binder, carried purely so that the hypothesis can be stated in the
membership form `S ∈ 𝕊_dens` that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecompMultChain`
produces and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialDenseSlabs_fullness_le` consumes; it is inferred
from `hSd` at every call site. -/

`μ(𝕎'_B) ≤ δ^{-2η} μ(𝕎''_B) ≤ δ^{-2η} (100/99) μ(𝕎'''_B)

are supplied by the `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinBallPositivity_*` group.

/-- **Constant in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard`** (blueprint
`def:ml2tangentialSlabDeltamaxConstant`, `C^Δ_{lem:ml2tangentialSlabDeltamax}`).

`CΔ` is *admissible* if it dominates the product of three losses: (a) the constant implicit in
the `⪅` of `factmaxmod2` of blueprint `lemmafactmaxbias`, at the ball `B` and the bias `ϱ`;
(b) the constant by which the anisotropic transport of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` distorts `Δ_max`; and (c) the square of the
absolute constant of blueprint `def:tubeCountFromDeltamaxConstant`.

Like `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabDecompMultConstant` this is a *predicate* on a constant and
not a formula, because (a) comes from a `⪅`, which `Kakeya.LEApprox` supplies only
existentially. Item (a) is the `Cbias` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bodies_antiClustering`,
the constant of GWZ (83) at `U = B` (clause (C4)); a producer of `SlabPackage` meets clause
(A3) from that field alone once `Cbias ≤ CΔ`, so it need not be
recorded here. Item (b) has no Lean form yet — it is precisely what clause (A3) of
`IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` assumes rather than derives — so what is recorded is item
(c), in the Lean shape it takes here: counting the rescaled bodies against the unit ball
through `ConvexSpaceBody.IsKatzTao.card_le_div_real` costs the reciprocal `3! = 6` of the
inscribed-simplex constant of `Convex.prod_thickness_le_volumeReal`, the volume `|B₁| ≤ 8` of
the unit ball and the cube `C₀³` of the thickness comparison constant, a product at most
`2^10 C₀³`. The predicate would have to be strengthened if (b) acquired a Lean form.

It is carried as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage.CΔAdmissible`, and `card_le` is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` reads: together with the fixed-scale threshold
`SlabPackage.CΔ_le`, `CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}`, it
gives `2^10 C₀³ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}`, which is exactly the absorption that step needs.
Taking that consequence as an independent field of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT` would duplicate the
same bound and impose an unnecessary additional assumption on that bundle. Note also that `one_le` is not
independent of `card_le`, since `C₀ ≥ 1`; it is kept because it is the sense in which `CΔ` is
a *loss*, and it is what the docstrings of the transport clauses appeal to.

What is used, and all that is used, is that some admissible `CΔ` is a function of `C₀`, of
`Cbias` and of absolute constants alone: independent of `S`, of `W` and of the scales `a`,
`b`, `r₁`, and sub-polynomial in `δ⁻¹`, so that the threshold `SlabPackage.CΔ_le` is
available. It is never a power of `δ`. -/

/-- **Katz–Tao input for the multiplicity inside a slab** (blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialSlabMult`(i)–(ii), i.e. the analytic half of `lem:ml2tangential`(b)).

The threshold exponent `η₁` is the opaque fullness threshold that GWZ Lemma 3.7 attaches to the pair
`(ϱ, β)`, and it is what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData` demands on the fullness side
of the estimate: fullness at `δ^{η₁}`. The one threshold field connects it to the chain that
has to discharge that side, and it is not implied by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams`, whose
budgets relate `η` to `ϱ` and say nothing about either against `η₁`:

* `fullness_threshold`, `9η ≤ η₁`, lets the density chain of blueprint
  `lem:ml2tangentialSlabFull` — which produces `λ(𝕋̃, Y_{𝕋̃}) ≥ δ^{9η}`, the `8η` of the
  density clause of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` plus the ninth `η` that
  `densityConstant` spends on the constant — discharge the fullness side.

The Katz–Tao side has no threshold clause. `estimate` is read at the `Δ_max` level `δ^{-3ϱ}`
that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao` supplies — clause (A3) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale`, `CΔ δ^{-2ϱ}`, with the threshold
`CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}` gives `Δ_max ≤ δ^{-5ϱ/2}` for the rescaled *geometric* family, and one
further half-power `δ^{-ϱ/2}` pays for the passage to the rescaled *shaded* family, whose
carriers are the enlarged ones, through
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement` — and at the loss
`4ϱ ≥ ϱ + 3ϱ(1-β)`, which is what Lemma 3.7 gives with `Δ_max^{1-β}` as a factor (GWZ (104):
`δ^{-O(ηbias)} δ^{-ηbias(1-β)} |𝕋̃|^β`). Requiring the additional condition
`katzTao_threshold`, `3ϱ ≤ η₁`, and evaluating `estimate` at the diagonal `(ϱ, η₁, η₁)` of
`KTRho2ScaleData` would give jointly unsatisfiable hypotheses for `β < 2/3`, since
`η₁(ϱ, β) ≤ ϱ/(1-β)` for every threshold `K_KT(β)` can provide.

`densityConstant` is blueprint `tangentialSlabDensityThreshold`, item (ii): the fixed-scale
threshold discharging the constant `tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C` of the density clause
against one further power `δ^{-η}`. -/
structure SlabMultKT (cfg : VeryNotSticky.{u}) {bd : BallData cfg}

  /-- the fullness threshold exponent `η₁(ϱ, β)` of GWZ Lemma 3.7 -/

  /-- `9η ≤ η₁`: the density chain reaches the fullness threshold.

  It reads `9η` and not `8η` because `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab.dense` reads `8η`
  (which in turn follows `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies` at `δ^{3η}`, read at the
  `tb` index `2η` — the (C5) exponent in the density clause) and
  `densityConstant` below charges one further `η`. This is a lower bound on **`η₁`**, not on
  `η`: `η₁` is the exponent threshold that GWZ Lemma 3.7 attaches to the pair `(ϱ, β)` and it
  is chosen after `η`, so raising the coefficient only forces a larger `η₁`. -/

  /-- GWZ Lemma 3.7 (`genKKT`) at this `δ` for bodies comparable to `ρ₂`-tubes, read at the

  rescaling plus the two absorbed constants), at the fullness threshold `η₁`, with loss
  `δ^{-4ϱ} ≥ δ^{-ϱ} · (δ^{-3ϱ})^{1-β}` (GWZ (104): `δ^{-O(ηbias)} δ^{-ηbias(1-β)}`). No
  threshold clause relates `ϱ` to `η₁`: `η₁(ϱ, β) ≤ ϱ/(1-β)` for every `K_KT`-derived
  threshold, so `3ϱ ≤ η₁` was unsatisfiable for `β < 2/3`. See
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData` for why it is stated for `ShadedBody` with a
  thickness hypothesis rather than for `ShadedTube`. -/

/-- **The slab package at a ball and a typical angle** (blueprint `lem:ml2tangential`(a)
together with the rescaling of item (b)).

This is everything the tangential leaf needs that depends on the ball `B` and on the typical
angle `ta.θ` with its constant `ta.Ctyp`: the slab family `𝕊` of blueprint
`hyp:ml2tangentialSlabFamily`, the admissible multiplicity constant `Cμ` with its fixed-scale
threshold `tangentialSlabMultThreshold`, and the anisotropic rescaling
`hyp:ml2anisotropicSlabRescale` with its constant `CΔ` and the threshold
`tangentialDeltamaxThreshold`.

The three groups travel together, and not as three bundles, because the rescaling clause
mentions the family: `rescale` is quantified over the pairs `(S, Wd)` that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` can return *out of this `𝕊`*, i.e. over
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab cfg ta 𝕊 S Wd`. Quantifying it over all convex bodies
would demand an affine map turning every contained body into a `ρ₂`-tube, which is
unsatisfiable and would make the hypothesis — and hence the leaf — vacuous; dropping the
angle clause from the antecedent has the same effect, for the reason recorded in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab`.

The package is indexed by the whole typical-angle bundle `ta` rather than by `θ` and `Ctyp`
separately, because `isSlabFamily` and `rescale` both need `ta.sel`, the index set the
refinement is recorded on; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab`. -/

/-- **The inputs of the tangential leaf** (blueprint `lem:ml2tangential`(a)–(c)).

One field per item of the blueprint statement. None of the three is implied by `cfg`, by
`params` or by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale`, and none of the three lemmas of this file
discharges its own, so they are received here and threaded from
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData` down through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_goalMult`,
`Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_b_le` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge`, exactly as `hβ1`, the thick-density
thresholds and `hslabScale` already are. That threading is what the blueprint means by "they
travel to the consumers of this leaf"; leaving it undone would leave the tangential branch of
`goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` open and its conclusion unearned.

`slab` is quantified over the ball and over the typical-angle package because the slab family
and the admissible constant depend on both, and neither is available at the point where the
bundle is arranged: the ball is chosen inside `goalMult_of_b_le` and the angle is produced
inside `goalMult_of_multBodies_ge`. -/

  exact `Tube.UniformTubeSet` and the loose `Kakeya.LooseUniform.LooseUniformTubeSet` both
  instantiate, so the field is *weaker* than before and every producer of the old field still
  serves it through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SplitInputs.toPB`. -/

/-- **Reduction to a single dense slab**.

In the tangential case the typicality of `θ` bounds the angle between the *normals* of any two
bodies of `𝕎''_B` that share a shaded point by `⪅ θ ≤ δ^{-τ'} a/b`. Decomposing `𝕎''_B` over a
maximal essentially disjoint family `𝕊` of slabs `S ⊆ B` with affine thicknesses
`∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)` therefore spreads each fibre over at most `δ^{-O(τ')}` of the
subfamilies

`𝕎''_S = {W ∈ 𝕎''_B : W ⊆ S and ∠(n(W), n(S)) ≤ 2θ}`,

and discarding the slabs on which the density `λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})` is less than a hundredth
of `λ(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` is a `⪆ 1` refinement. What survives is a *single* slab, the one
realising the maximum, which is why the conclusion is an existential over one `S` rather than
over a dense subfamily.

The family `𝕊` is *data*, not output: its existence is a maximality argument that the
blueprint does not carry out, so it is assumed here in the form
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`, exactly as the blueprint statement assumes it, and the
selected slab is returned together with its membership `S ∈ 𝕊`. It travels, with the
admissible multiplicity constant and its threshold, in the single bundle
`sp : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage cfg ta` — the same bundle
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TangentialInputs.slab` produces — whose fields `sp.𝕊`,
`sp.isSlabFamily`, `sp.Cμ`, `sp.CμAdmissible` and `sp.Cμ_le` are what this statement reads.

The two data returned are the slab `S` and the index set `Wd` of `𝕎''_S ⊆ 𝕎''_B`; the shading
on it is the refined shading `ta.YW` produced together with `θ` by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`, restricted to `Wd`. Their seven geometric
clauses — membership in `𝕊`, the two clauses of (S2), non-emptiness, containment in `ta.sel`
and the angle — together with the density clause are bundled as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab`, which is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` consumes and what the rescaling hypothesis of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt` is quantified over. The angle clause is stated
with `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`, the normal of blueprint `def:ml2bodyNormal`, on both sides:
it is what makes the rescaling of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult` turn the bodies of
`𝕎''_S` into `ρ₂`-tubes — the stretch acts in the thin direction of `S`, so what it needs is
that the thin direction of `W` be aligned with it — and without it that lemma is false. Read
on `bodyAxis`, the clause would constrain the long directions and
would not control the thin-direction rescaling.

The plank presentation, the angle `θ`, its constant `Ctyp` and the refinement `(𝕎''_B, YW)`
travel in the bundle `ta : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData cfg tc hB τ'`, the output of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`; the hypothesis `a/b ≤ θ` of the blueprint
statement is `ta.hθab'`.

**The two clauses, and their constants.** Only the multiplicity clause is a separate conjunct
of the conclusion; the density clause is the field `IsDenseSlab.dense`, whose exponent and
constant are discussed there. The multiplicity clause renders the blueprint's
`δ^{-O(τ')}` by the explicit factor `δ^{-C_sep τ'/4}`, one quarter of the budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.parameterSeparationConstant`. Three powers of `δ` are charged to that
quarter: the `δ^{-2τ'}` of the fibre count, the `δ^{-2η}` that the passage from `𝕎'_B` to the
`c`-refinement `𝕎''_B` costs (blueprint `lem:ml2multRefine`; the earlier statement of this
clause did not name it), and the further `δ^{-τ'}` that pays for the constant `sp.Cμ` by the
threshold `sp.Cμ_le`, blueprint `tangentialSlabMultThreshold`. That
`3τ' + 2η ≤ C_sep τ'/4` is blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecompExponent`, which needs
`7η < τ'` and hence `params.transverse` together with `hβ1 : β ≤ 1` — the only genuine
relation between the parameters used here, the rest being the generosity of
`C_sep/4 = 2^18`.

`Wd.Nonempty` is part of `IsDenseSlab` because the selected slab lies in `𝕊_dens`, whose
definition `tangentialSdens` requires `𝕎''_S ≠ ∅`; it is the hypothesis of blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialSlabRescale`, so `tangentialSlabMult` cannot do without it.

The non-slab case hypothesis `b ≤ δ^{2·exscal}` is *not* a binder here. The blueprint proof —
the fibre count via typicality and axis separation, the density chain, and the exponent check
`lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecompExponent` — never reads it. Nor does
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`, whose Katz–Tao input is stated at the scale `ρ₂`
itself: the hypothesis is spent only in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound`, in the form
`ρ₂ ≤ δ^{exscal}`, and it enters this file exactly once, as the binder `hnotslab` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`. -/

/-! ### Multiplicity inside one dense slab

The commentary below belongs to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`, stated at the end of
this section; it is a section note rather than that theorem's docstring because the four steps
of its proof are isolated as private lemmas in between.

Let `S` be the dense slab produced by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` and put
`ρ₂ = b / r₁`. The linear change of variables carrying `S` to the unit ball sends the two
axes of length `∼ r₁` to unit length and stretches the short axis, of length `∼ (a/b) r₁`, by
`∼ b/a`; a body `W ∈ 𝕎''_S` has affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` and, by the angle clause,
its *normal* is within `θ` of that of `S` — so its thin direction is the one the stretch acts
in — and it is carried to a `ρ₂`-tube. That is the content
of blueprint `hyp:ml2anisotropicSlabRescale`, an *assumption*: the blueprint has the
isotropic homothety toolkit but not the anisotropic comparison, so the rescaling is carried
in the bundle `sp : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage cfg ta` — the same bundle
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TangentialInputs.slab` produces and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` consumes — as the map `sp.L S`, the constant
`sp.CΔ` with `sp.CΔAdmissible`, and `sp.rescale S Wd hslab : IsAnisotropicSlabRescale cfg S Wd
(sp.L S) sp.CΔ`. The family
`𝕎''_S` becomes a family `𝕋̃` of `ρ₂`-tubes in the unit ball with the same `λ` and the same
`μ` (blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabRescale`, whose hypotheses are `hWdne` and the positivity
of the shaded union), and with

`Δ_max(𝕋̃) ≤ CΔ δ^{-2ϱ} ≤ δ^{-5ϱ/2}` and `|𝕋̃| ≤ δ^{-3ϱ} ρ₂^{-2}`,

blueprint `tangentialDeltamaxConclusion`. The first inequality is clause (A3) of `hL`,
blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialDeltamaxTransport`, which folds into `CΔ` the `⪅` constant of the
biased maximal density factoring bound `factmaxmod2` of `lemmafactmaxbias` (through
`Δ_max(𝕎''_S) ≤ Δ_max(𝕎_B)`, GWZ (83) at `U = B` — `Cbias δ^{-2ϱ}`, the (C4) field
`bodies_antiClustering` of `bd`), the distortion of the transport itself and the constant of
`lem:tubeCountFromDeltamax`; the second follows from it. Of the two half-powers, one pays for
`sp.CΔ` itself and the other for the absorbed `δ`-free constant — `volume_comparison.C 3` in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao`, `48 C₀³` in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` — which
`sp.CΔAdmissible.card_le` (`2^10 C₀³ ≤ CΔ`) routes through the same threshold; both are
discharged by `sp.CΔ_le`, `CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}`, blueprint `tangentialDeltamaxThreshold`, and it is (A3) that keeps `sp.CΔ` from being vacuous: the two
hypotheses pull in opposite directions.

GWZ Lemma 3.7 is then run with `ϱ` in place of `ε` through
`kt.estimate`, read at the `Δ_max` level `δ^{-3ϱ}` and at the loss `4ϱ ≥ ϱ + 3ϱ(1-β)` — GWZ
(104), `δ^{-O(ηbias)} δ^{-ηbias(1-β)} |𝕋̃|^β`, the factor `δ^{-ηbias(1-β)}` being `Δ_max^{1-β}`
— giving `μ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S}) = μ(𝕋̃, Y_{𝕋̃}) ≤ δ^{-4ϱ} |𝕋̃|^β ≤ δ^{-7ϱ} ρ₂^{-2β}`, using
`(δ^{-3ϱ})^β ≤ δ^{-3ϱ}` and hence `hβ1 : β ≤ 1`. Blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialSlabMultAbsorb` with `k = 2`, `m = 7` turns the display into the conclusion:
one quarter `δ^{-C_sep ϱ/4}` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.parameterSeparationConstant`, of whose
`2^18` available powers seven are spent.

The two constants of blueprint `tangentialSlabMultAbsorbThreshold` do not appear. Both `⪅`
of the blueprint display are constant-free in the Lean rendering: the Katz–Tao one is absorbed
into `kt.estimate`, which is the *cross-section* form of
`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.multiplicity_bound_generalize` and carries no implicit factor, and the
change-of-variables one is absorbed into
`tangentialSlabRescaleInvariance`, which asserts equality of `λ` and of `μ`. Carrying them as
free parameters `Cabs₁`, `Cabs₂` occurring only in their own thresholds would have been
vacuous.

**The fullness hypothesis, and where the corrected `8η` lands.** `hslab.dense` is the density
clause of `tangentialSlabDecomp`,
`δ^{8η} ≤ tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C · λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`, with the factor `100` of
the slab selection and the doubled exponent forced as recorded there.
It is consumed at exactly one place, blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabFull`: with
`kt.densityConstant`,
the threshold `tangentialSlabDensityThreshold` discharging the constant
`tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C` against a
ninth `δ^{η}`, it gives `λ(𝕋̃, Y_{𝕋̃}) ≥ δ^{9η} ≥ δ^{η₁}` and hence the fullness hypothesis of
`K_KT(β)`. So the correction is invisible in the conclusion, which is unchanged, and it does
not enter the accumulated budget of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt` either.

The fullness threshold `η₁` and the one inequality that bounds it travel in
`kt : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT cfg tc`, together with `kt.densityConstant`, blueprint
item (ii). `kt.fullness_threshold`, `9η ≤ η₁`, is not implied by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams`: the budgets of `params` relate `η` to `ϱ`, whereas `η₁` is
the opaque threshold that GWZ Lemma 3.7 attaches to the pair `(ϱ, β)`,
and `η ≪ ϱ` says nothing about `η` against `η₁`. It has content here because `η₁` is the
threshold at which `kt.estimate` demands its fullness hypothesis: `9η ≤ η₁` is what lets the
density chain `λ(𝕋̃, Y_{𝕋̃}) ≥ δ^{9η}` discharge the fullness side. The Katz–Tao side has no
threshold clause: `kt.estimate` is read at the `Δ_max` level `δ^{-3ϱ}` that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao` supplies, exactly as Lemma 3.7 takes `Δ_max` as a factor.
Adding `kt.katzTao_threshold : 3ϱ ≤ η₁` and evaluating `kt.estimate`
at the diagonal density level `δ^{-η₁}` would give jointly unsatisfiable hypotheses for `β < 2/3`, because `η₁(ϱ, β) ≤ ϱ/(1-β)` for every threshold
`K_KT(β)` can provide.

`kt.estimate` is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData`, not
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTScaleData`: the latter speaks only about subfamilies `s' ⊆ cfg.s` of
the fixed family of `δ`-tubes at the fixed fullness threshold `δ^{cfg.η}`, and says nothing
about `μ(Wd, YW)`, whereas what is needed here is the estimate for the rescaled family of
`ρ₂`-tubes in `B₁` indexed by `Wd ⊆ bd.ω` at the threshold `δ^{η₁}` — the reading at the small
Katz–Tao parameter `τ = δ ≤ ρ₂` of Remark `multBoundsDeltaVsRho`. Together with the
threshold clause this is blueprint item (i).

The eight clauses about the pair `(S, Wd)` travel in
`hslab : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab cfg ta sp.𝕊 S Wd`, the conclusion of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp` at the same `sp`; the family itself is used only
to instantiate `sp.rescale`, this lemma otherwise reading `hslab.mem`'s companions alone.

**Why the shading is `ta.YW`.** A free
`YW : bd.ω → ShadedBody (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))` together with `θ`, `hθab`, and `hθ1`
would make the statement refutable: nothing would link `YW j` to the factoring body
`bd.Wb j`, so taking every `YW j` to be one and the same fully shaded body made
`λ(Wd, YW) = 1` — hence the density hypothesis vacuously true — while `μ(Wd, YW) = |Wd|`,
which the Katz–Tao input bounds only by `≈ δ^{-3ϱ} ρ₂^{-2}`, above the conclusion's
`δ^{-C_sep ϱ/4} ρ₂^{-2β}` for `ρ₂` near `δ^{1-exscal}`. Taking the refinement bundle `ta` and
reading the shading off it as `ta.YW` repairs this: `hslab.subset : Wd ⊆ ta.sel` together with
`ta.hrefine` gives `(ta.YW j).toConvexSpaceBody = ((tc.thinBall hB).W j).toConvexSpaceBody` for
every `j ∈ Wd`, and the enlargement sandwich `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.Wb_le_W` /
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.W_le_cthickening` places that body between the geometric body
`bd.Wb j` and its closed `τ₂(bd.Wb j)`-neighbourhood. The equality
`(ta.YW j).toConvexSpaceBody = bd.Wb j` of the earlier statement is *false* for the corrected
factoring proposition, whose outer bodies are genuine enlargements; what replaces it is the
sandwich, and the sandwich is exactly what makes the geometric clauses of `hslab` — stated
about `bd.Wb` — still bear on the shaded family the conclusion is about. Each such passage
costs at most one factor of `2` in a comparison constant or one factor
`Metric.volume_comparison.C 3` in a density, and both are charged where they are used: the
first to the comparison constant `2 bd.C₀` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData`, the
second to the `Δ_max` level `δ^{-3ϱ}` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabKatzTao` through
`sp.CΔAdmissible.card_le` and `sp.CΔ_le`. The
localisation, the tube profile and the `Δ_max` bound for the enlarged carriers come
respectively from clause (A1'), clause (A2') and
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement`.
It also removes `YW`, `θ`, `hθab` and `hθ1` as separate binders: the angle bounds
`a/b ≤ θ ≤ 1` are `ta.hθab'` and `ta.hθ1`, and they are still used for the same two purposes
as before, the lower bound in the fibre geometry and the upper bound in making the tilt of a
body against the *normal* of `S` at most one, which the rescaling needs. This lemma does *not*
read `ta.htyp` — typicality is spent in `tangentialSlabDecomp`, in the fibre count.

The blueprint's third expression `ρ₂^{βζ} |𝕋_{ρ₂}|^β` is *not* used: it is obtained from
`ρ₂^{-2β}` by `|𝕋_{ρ₂}| ≥ ρ₂^{-2-ζ}`, and the assembly cancels it again against the
`ρ₂^{(2+ζ)β}` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound`, so the middle form is the one that
keeps the combination free of the family `𝕋_{ρ₂}`. -/

/-- **The volume of a body with a `ρ`-tube thickness profile** (the inscribed-simplex input of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard`).

A convex bounded body whose affine thicknesses are comparable, with constant `C₀`, to the
`ρ`-tube profile `(1, ρ, ρ)` has volume at least `ρ² / (6 C₀³)`. The `6` is `3!`, the reciprocal
of the inscribed-simplex constant `Metric.lt_volume_convexHull.c 3` of
`Convex.prod_thickness_le_volumeReal`, and the `C₀³` is one factor of `C₀` per axis: by
definition `HasThicknesses K C₀ t` unfolds to
`∀ k, (C₀ : ℝ)⁻¹ * t k ≤ Metric.thickness ℝ K k ∧ Metric.thickness ℝ K k ≤ C₀ * t k`,
so the product over the three axes is at least `C₀⁻³ * 1 * ρ * ρ`.

It is isolated because it is the one genuinely geometric step of the cardinality count, the rest
of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` being the Katz–Tao counting lemma and bookkeeping.

It is the single statement of this fact in the development, and it is public so that the
`KTRho2` interface can cite it: its `ENNReal` form
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ofReal_le_volume_of_tubeProfile` (`MainLemma2/KTRho2Interface.lean`) is a
one-line application of it. -/

/-- **Step 1 of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`: the dense slab is `δ^{η₁}`-full**
.

The density clause `hslab.dense` of the selected slab reads
`δ^{8η} ≤ tangentialSlabDecompConstant tc.C * λ(𝕎''_S, Y_{𝕎''_S})`, and `kt.densityConstant`
discharges that constant against a ninth power `δ^{η}`, giving `λ ≥ δ^{9η}`. Since `0 < δ ≤ 1`
the map `s ↦ δ^s` is antitone, so `kt.fullness_threshold : 9η ≤ η₁` turns that into
`λ ≥ δ^{η₁}`, which is the fullness hypothesis of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData`.

This is stated for the original shading `ta.YW`; the assembly transports it to the rescaled
family by `ShadedBody.fullness_affineImage`, which is an equality. -/

/-- **Step 2 of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`: the rescaled family is Katz–Tao at
`δ^{-3ϱ}`** (blueprint `lem:ml2tangentialSlabDeltamax`, first half).

Clause (A3) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` gives
`Δ_max(L(𝕎''_S)) ≤ CΔ δ^{-2ϱ}` for any realisation of the image family of the *geometric*
bodies `bd.Wb` as convex bodies. What the Katz–Tao estimate is applied to is the image family
of the *shaded* carriers `((tc.thinBall hB).W j).carrier`, which are enlargements of those
bodies, so a third step is needed.

Three inequalities chain. `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.isVolumeControlledEnlargement` makes the
outer carriers a `volume_comparison.C 3`-volume-controlled enlargement of `bd.Wb` in the sense
of `ConvexSpaceBody.IsVolumeControlledEnlargement`; an affine equivalence multiplies every
volume by the same factor `|det L|` and preserves inclusions, so the property survives the
transport with the *same* constant; and
`ConvexSpaceBody.IsVolumeControlledEnlargement.isKatzTao` then transfers the bound, giving
`Δ_max ≤ volume_comparison.C 3 · CΔ δ^{-2ϱ}` for the enlarged image family. The two constants
are absorbed half a power of `δ^{-ϱ}` each: `volume_comparison.C 3 = 384 ≤ 2^10 C₀³ ≤ CΔ` by
`sp.CΔAdmissible.card_le`, and `CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}` by `sp.CΔ_le`, twice (using the half exponents in (A3) and `CΔ_le`). That leaves `δ^{-3ϱ}`,
which is the conclusion: it is the `Δ_max` level at which
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT.estimate` is read (weakening it further to `δ^{-η₁}` through a threshold clause `3ϱ ≤ η₁`, unsatisfiable for
`β < 2/3` since `η₁(ϱ, β) ≤ ϱ/(1-β)` for every threshold `K_KT(β)` can provide). Monotonicity
of `ConvexSpaceBody.IsKatzTao` in its constant does the rest.

The half-power spent on `volume_comparison.C 3` is the whole cost of the correction to
Proposition 5.1 at this step: with `(tc.thinBall hB).W j = bd.Wb j` the middle inequality is
the identity and `δ^{-5ϱ/2}` would do.

The realisation `V` is quantified rather than named, exactly as in (A3), because the image of an
affine equivalence does not carry the convexity, compactness and interior data of
`ConvexSpaceBody` for free; the hypothesis `hV` pins down the carriers, which is all that
`Δ_max` sees. -/

/-- **Step 3 of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabMult`: the rescaled family is small**
(blueprint `tangentialDeltamaxConclusion`, `|𝕋̃| ≤ δ^{-3ϱ} ρ₂^{-2}`).

Count the rescaled bodies inside the unit ball with
`ConvexSpaceBody.IsKatzTao.card_le_div_real`, using the Katz–Tao bound
`CΔ δ^{-2ϱ} ≤ δ^{-5ϱ/2}` of clause (A3) with the threshold `sp.CΔ_le` and
the volume lower bound supplied by `Convex.prod_thickness_le_volumeReal`: each image body is,
by clause (A2), of thicknesses comparable to `(1, ρ₂, ρ₂)` with constant `bd.C₀`, so its volume
is at least `ρ₂² / (6 bd.C₀³)`, the `6` being `3!`, the reciprocal of the inscribed-simplex
constant in dimension three. The containment in the unit ball is clause (A1) together with
`hslab.bodies_subset`.

That produces `|𝕎''_S| ≤ 6 bd.C₀³ |B₁| δ^{-5ϱ/2} ρ₂^{-2}`, and the absolute factor
`6 bd.C₀³ |B₁| ≤ 2^10 bd.C₀³` is absorbed into the remaining half-power `δ^{-ϱ/2}`, leaving
the displayed form. That absorption is a *threshold* and not an exponent charge: by the
constant/exponent distinction at the head of this file a factor `δ^{-s}` with `s > 0` is `≥ 1`
but does not dominate a given constant, since `δ` is allowed up to `1`, so the quarter budget
`δ^{-C_sep ϱ/4}` cannot pay for it and half a power `δ^{-ϱ/2}` is spent here instead — the
spare power the blueprint's `δ^{-3ϱ}` carries over the `δ^{-2ϱ}` that `Δ_max` alone supplies,
split into two half-power factors: one for `CΔ`, one here.

It is not assumed. The two clauses of the package do it: `sp.CΔAdmissible.card_le`, item (c)
of blueprint `def:ml2tangentialSlabDeltamaxConstant`, gives `2^10 bd.C₀³ ≤ CΔ`, and
`sp.CΔ_le`, blueprint `tangentialDeltamaxThreshold`, gives `CΔ ≤ δ^{-ϱ/2}`. -/

Pure `ENNReal` arithmetic, with no geometry and no constants left in it. Substituting the

/-- **Multiplicity inside one dense slab**.

At the dense slab `S` produced by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`, the anisotropic
rescaling of blueprint `hyp:ml2anisotropicSlabRescale` turns `𝕎''_S` into a family of
`ρ₂`-tubes in the unit ball with the same `μ` and the same `λ`, and the Katz–Tao estimate for
`ρ₂`-tubes bounds its multiplicity by `δ^{-7ϱ} ρ₂^{-2β}`, which fits inside the quarter budget
`δ^{-C_sep ϱ/4}`.

The proof is the composition of the four steps `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabFullness`,
`slabKatzTao`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabCard` and `slabMultAbsorb`
above, the transport between the two coordinate systems being
`ShadedBody.fullness_affineImage` and `ShadedBody.multiplicity_affineImage`, both exact. See
the section note above for the full commentary.

The blueprint statement of `lem:ml2tangentialSlabMult` also lists the case hypotheses
`params`, `b ≤ δ^{2·exscal}` and `θ < δ^{-τ'} a/b`; none of them is a binder here, because
the argument never reads them. The tangential and non-slab case distinctions are spent one
step earlier, in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`, which produces the dense slab
`hslab`, and the parameter budget is spent one step later, in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt`. What this lemma needs of the case is exactly
`hslab` and the rescaling `sp.rescale` it feeds. -/

/-- [Main Lemma 2, tangential case].
In the configuration `cfg`, together with the per-ball data `bd` of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup`, the thin-case configuration `tc` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over it,
a ball `B ∈ 𝔅`, the thin-case refinement `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` and
`b ≤ δ^{exscal} r_1 = δ^{2·exscal}`, with `θ` a typical angle of intersection with constant
`Ctyp` (blueprint Def 6.12, `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle`) for the plank
family `P` realising the factoring slabs `𝕎'_B` (aspect ratio `a'/b' = a/b`), and `τ'` as in
`goalMult_of_theta_ge`,
suppose we are in the *tangential case*, i.e. `θ < δ^{-τ'} (a/b)`. The field
`params.tangential` replaces the blueprint's `O(ϱ + τ')` loss by the explicit coefficient
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.parameterSeparationConstant`. The multiplicity estimate `eqgoalmuT`
then holds with the gain

`ν = exscal β ζ / 2`.

The weaker conclusion `∃ ν > 0, cfg.goalMult ν` was insufficient:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` must conclude the *named* exponent
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bigmultExponent`, the minimum of `½ τ' β` and `½ exscal β ζ`, and an
existentially bound gain cannot be weakened to it.

As in the transverse case, the plank family is indexed by `bd.ω` and carried by the family
`𝕎'_B` of the thin-case data at `B`, i.e. `(tc.thinBall hB).bodies'`, and the plank
presentation, the angle, its constant and the `⪆ 1` refinement `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` travel in
the single bundle `ta : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData cfg tc hB τ'`, which is exactly
what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` returns. The field
`scale.rho2Star_le_one` ensures that the dilated scale `ρ₂*` remains at most one.

`hBmax` is consumed only through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabSplitBound`; see its docstring
for why it is not available from `cfg` alone. `hβ1 : β ≤ 1` is consumed three times over: by
`nonslabSplitBound`, by `tangentialSlabDecomp` (through the exponent check
`lem:ml2tangentialSlabDecompExponent`, which turns `params.transverse` into `7η < τ'`) and by
`tangentialSlabMult` (in the form `(δ^{-3ϱ})^β ≤ δ^{-3ϱ}`).

Items (a)–(c) of blueprint `lem:ml2tangential` are carried explicitly, since none of the
three lemmas above discharges them and nothing else in the tangential case does either. They
travel in the single bundle `tin : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TangentialInputs cfg tc τ'`, one
field per item: `tin.slab` is item (a) together with the rescaling of item (b),
`tin.slabMult` the analytic half of item (b), `tin.split` item (c). The bundle is threaded up
to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData`, so that the consumers of this leaf carry it rather
than assume its conclusion; see its docstring. The two Katz–Tao hypotheses it contains are
genuinely different cross-sections: `tin.split.katzTao` is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTScaleData`, needed by `nonslabSplitBound` for subfamilies of the
`δ`-tubes `cfg.T`, while `tin.slabMult.estimate` is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleData`, needed by `tangentialSlabMult` for the rescaled
`ρ₂`-tubes.

The slab family `𝕊` of blueprint `hyp:ml2tangentialSlabFamily` is assumed, not constructed;
see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`. Correspondingly the rescaling data `L` and
`SlabPackage.rescale` are quantified over exactly the pairs `(S, Wd)` that
`tangentialSlabDecomp` can return out of that `𝕊`, i.e. over
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab cfg ta sp.𝕊 S Wd`. Quantifying `L` over *all* convex
bodies would demand an affine map turning every contained body into a `ρ₂`-tube, which is
unsatisfiable, and would make the hypothesis — and hence this leaf — vacuous; so would
listing the clauses of `IsDenseSlab` by hand and omitting the angle clause, which an earlier
version of this statement did.

The thin-case hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` is *not* carried: the tangential chain never reads it,
`hnotslab` being the only case hypothesis its three lemmas consume, so it was dropped rather
than retained as an unused argument.

The proof is the arithmetic of the blueprint. `tangentialSlabDecomp` and
`tangentialSlabMult` give the outer factor
`μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ≤ δ^{-C_sep(ϱ+τ')/4} ρ₂^{-2β}`; substituting it into
`nonslabSplitBound` cancels `ρ₂^{-2β}` against `ρ₂^{(2+ζ)β}` and leaves `ρ₂^{ζβ}`, which
`rho2_range` bounds by `δ^{exscal ζ β}`. The three quarter-budgets sum to at most
`C_sep(ϱ+τ')`, since `η < ϱ` by `params.densityBias` and `τ' > 0`, and `params.tangential`
bounds that by `½ exscal β ζ`, leaving exactly the required gain. -/

/-- **[Main Lemma 2, tangential case] with the gain left existential**.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt_explicit` read at `ν = ½ exscal β ζ`, which is
positive by `cfg.hexscal`, `cfg.hβ` and `cfg.hζ`. It is the blueprint's own phrasing — "the
goal holds with a positive gain, the blueprint value being `ν = exscal β ζ / 2`" — and is kept
so that blueprint `lem:ml2tangential` has a Lean statement in that shape.

It carries the *same* hypotheses as the explicit form. It is restated with
the explicit form's hypotheses, and proved from it, rather than deleted, because blueprint
`lem:ml2tangential` points its `\lean{...}` at this name.

Like the explicit form it carries `hβ1` without using it; see that docstring. -/
