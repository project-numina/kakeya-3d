# The anisotropic change of variables of the tangential slab step (row G9)

Row G9 of the general `(a, b)` branch: the tangential slab package
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage` at a general pair of plank dimensions `(a, b)`, of which the
existing `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_slabPackage_degenerate_of_margin`
(`MainLemma2/TangentialSlabDegenerate.lean`) is the `a = b` instance.

GWZ (GWZ) cover the ball `B` by a maximal family `𝕊` of essentially distinct
slabs of dimensions `(a/b) r₁ × r₁ × r₁`, sort the bodies of `𝕎''_B` into the subfamilies
`𝕎''_S` of equation (28), and, for a dense slab `S`, make "a linear change of variables that
converts `S` to `B₁` and converts `𝕎''_S` to a set `𝕋̃` of `ρ₂`-tubes in `B₁`". At `a = b` that
change of variables is the isotropic homothety `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankRescale`; at general
`(a, b)` it must stretch by `b/(a r₁)` along the normal `n(S)` of the slab and by `1/r₁` in the
plane `n(S)^⊥`, since the slab is thin exactly in the direction `n(S)`.

This file builds that map and everything the package needs that does **not** depend on the slab
family being constructed:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aniLin`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aniLinEquiv`,
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aniRescale` — the anisotropic change of variables, with its composition
  law, its norm identity, its two Lipschitz constants and its inverse;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRescale` — the instance at `(α, β) = (1/r₁, b/(a r₁))` that GWZ's
  step uses, together with `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRescale_eq_plankRescale`, which says that at
  `a = b` it **is** `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.degenerateRescale`, so the degenerate file's map is the
  degenerate value of this one and nothing is duplicated;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.generalSlab` — the slab of dimensions `∼ (r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)` carried
  *exactly* onto the unit ball by `slabRescale`, so that clause (A1) of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale` is an equality and not an estimate;
* clause (A1') from a margin hypothesis, in the same form as for
  the degenerate route, and clauses `Cμ`, `CΔ`, (A3) which are already `(a, b)`-free in the existing
  degenerate file and are re-exported here rather than re-proved.

## What is **not** here, and why — the two obstructions of row G9

**(i) Clause (A2) is four-sixths a theorem and two-sixths an obligation.** The transport of a
thickness profile under an *isotropic* map is an exact rescaling
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_plankRescale_image` carries `C₀` to `C₀`), which is why the
degenerate file closes (A2) with no loss. Under `aniRescale` no thickness scales exactly: the
sharp unconditional brackets are `α τ_k(X) ≤ τ_k(L X) ≤ β τ_k(X)`
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickness_aniRescale_image_mem`), with `α = 1/r₁` and `β = b/(a r₁)`.
Against (A2)'s six inequalities that settles four of them, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_slabRescale_image_of_two` proves exactly those four:
rank `0` upper (from clause (A1)), rank `0` lower, rank `1` lower, and rank `2` upper — the last
being the one place the anisotropy pays, `β · C₀ a = C₀ b/r₁ = C₀ ρ₂` exactly.

The two that remain are **rank `1` upper** and **rank `2` lower**. The rank-`2` lower gap is
arithmetic: the transport gives `τ₂(L X) ≥ a/(C₀ r₁)` and (A2) demands `ρ₂/C₀ = b/(C₀ r₁)`, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.aniLin_rank_two_gap` compiles the strict inequality between them at every
`a < b`; they coincide exactly at `a = b`. Both missing halves are paid by the same geometric
input — the body's thin direction must lie within `∼ a/b` of `n(S)` — quantified by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.norm_aniLin_le_of_inner_le`. What `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab`
supplies instead is `axisAngle (bd.Wb j) S ≤ 2θ`, and the only upper bound on `θ` in
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData` is `hθ1 : θ ≤ 1` — vacuous relative to `a/b` as soon as
`a < b`, and *exactly* the needed bound when `a = b`. So (A2) at general `(a, b)` needs either a
new upper bound on the typical angle or a re-cut of the clause at a constant `C(bd.C₀)` rather
than `bd.C₀`, in the way (A2') already reads at `2 bd.C₀`. It is therefore carried here as an
explicit hypothesis of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_slabPackage_general`, in the byte-exact shape
of the field, and reported rather than forced.

**(ii) Clauses (S3) and (S4) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` constrained one another —
RULED and RE-CUT.** As originally written, (S4) asked that *distinct* slabs of
`𝕊` have `c(C₀) (a/b)`-separated normals, so `𝕊` contained no two distinct **parallel** slabs;
(S3) asks that every body of `𝕎''_B` be *contained* in its assigned slab. At `a = b` the one slab
is the ball itself and both are trivial; at `a < b` a slab is thin, so the bodies of one normal
direction that are spread across `B` need many slabs, all of which the old (S4) forced to be
mutually tilted. Against the source that is decisive: GWZ's family is "a maximal set of
essentially disjoint slabs `S ⊂ B`" (GWZ), which contains `∼ b/a` **parallel
translates** per direction, so the old (S4) excluded GWZ's own family.

The separation in (S4) is required only of slabs whose
`C₀ a`-thickenings meet, which is the only situation GWZ use it in and the only situation the sole
consumer `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` reads it in. The compiled form of the old
collision is preserved here, with the guard added:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily.eq_of_bodyNormal_eq_of_overlap` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily.subset_common_slab_of_bodyNormal_eq`. Under the re-cut the
guard is a genuine restriction and the family is no longer excluded by its own clauses; the
family itself is still not constructed here.

This is the quantitative form of the alignment obligation of row G9. Applied to the long edge of
a body of profile `(r₁, b, a)` inside a slab of normal `n`, at `α = 1/r₁` and `β = b/(a r₁)`, it
gives `‖L v‖ ≤ 1 + (b/(a r₁)) s`; the clause (A2) target for that edge is `∼ 1`, so the edge's
component along `n(S)` must be `s ≲ a r₁ / b`, i.e. the tilt must be `≲ a/b`. The only bound
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab` supplies is `axisAngle ≤ 2θ` with `θ ≤ 1`

/-! ### The two-sided thickness profile of the slab — clause (S2) -/

/-- **A contained disc forces the rank-`1` thickness, with no loss at all.**

If `X` contains the disc of radius `R` about `c` in the plane `n^⊥`, then `X` is not within `R`
of any line. This is the tool clause (S2) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` needs, and it
**replaces the volume route**:  item 4 asked for the determinant of a
rank-one update (`LinearMap.det (id + c • (n ⊗ n))`) so that
`Kakeya.volume_le_prod_thickness` could be run backwards; Mathlib has no such lemma (`loogle`
on `LinearMap.det (LinearMap.id + _)`, `Matrix.det_one_add_col_mul_row`,
`LinearMap.det_one_add_smulRight`: all empty). This is sharper anyway — the volume route returns
the rank-`1` bound at `π/6 ≈ 0.52` of the truth, this one at `1`.

**The proof is two points and a parallelogram.** Given `X ⊆ N_r(A)` with `A` of rank ≤ 1, pick a
unit `u` orthogonal to *both* `n` and `A.direction` (available since
`dim(ℝ∙n ⊔ A.direction) ≤ 2 < 3`). The two disc points `c ± R u` lie in `X`, so each is within
`r + ε` of some `y± ∈ A`; and `⟪c - y₊, u⟫ = ⟪c - y₋, u⟫` because `y₊ - y₋ ∈ A.direction ⊥ u`, so
the two squared distances sum to `‖c-y₊‖² + ‖c-y₋‖² + 2R² ≥ 2R²`. Hence `2(r+ε)² ≥ 2R²`. -/

/-! ### Clauses (A1) and (A1′) produced, for a family of normalising slabs -/


/-! ### The output theorem: the slab package at general `(a, b)` -/

/-- **`exists_slabPackage_general` — the tangential slab package at a general `(a, b)`.**

Row G9's output. The three constants and clause (A3) are supplied here from the existing
degenerate file, where they are already free of `a` and `b`:

* `Cμ := degenerateCμ bd.C₀ ta.Ctyp` is the least admissible value of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabDecompMultConstant`, a function of `bd.C₀` and `ta.Ctyp` only;
* `CΔ := degenerateCΔ bd.C₀ bd.Cbias = 2^10 C₀³ Cbias` is the `δ`-free
  constant;
* clause (A3) is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.isKatzTao_affineImage_of_antiClustering`, which holds for **every** affine equivalence `L`, hence for the anisotropic one.

What is *not* supplied is the slab family and the two thickness clauses (A2), (A2'): they are the
binders `hfam`, `hA2`, `hA2'`, stated in the byte-exact texts of the fields of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsAnisotropicSlabRescale`. See the
module docstring for why each is an obligation and not a gap in this proof. -/
