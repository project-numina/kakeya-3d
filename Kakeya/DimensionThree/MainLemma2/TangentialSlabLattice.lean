# The lattice slab cells of the refined plank-to-tube estimate (C3-b), part I

GWZ build the slab family of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` as a
**bounded-overlap cover by lattice cells**, not as a maximal essentially disjoint family:

> "Choose a fixed `cθ`-net of unoriented normal directions. For a net normal `ν`, choose a
> lattice of spacing `cθ` only in the coordinate `⟨x,ν⟩`, and give the corresponding slab a
> normal width `Cθ` and two fixed tangential widths large enough to contain `B₁`. Assign a
> plank to the first slab whose normal is closest to its short John axis and whose normal
> interval contains it. … At a shaded point, the typical-angle property confines all relevant
> normals to one `O(θ)`-cap; separation of the normal net and of the one-dimensional lattice
> therefore leaves only `O(1)` possible slab labels."
> (GWZ)

This file carries the four *reusable* pieces of that construction — the ones that are
independent of the bookkeeping and that every version of the assembly needs — together with
one measured obstruction.

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.abs_inner_first_le_of_lineAngle_le` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.abs_inner_sub_le_of_aligned` — **the tilted-width estimate**: the width
  of a body in a direction `ν` within `κ` of its own normal is at most
  `2 (κ (τ₀ + τ₁) + τ₂)`. This is what makes the containment clause (S3) provable *by
  construction* for a cell whose normal is a net normal rather than the body's own: without it
  the assignment "the first slab whose normal interval contains it" cannot be verified, since
  the body's extent along the *cell's* normal is not one of its own thicknesses.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_maximal_pairwise_not` — **the greedy net**, in the only form the
  construction needs. The source's "fixed `cθ`-net of unoriented normal directions" and its
  "lattice of spacing `cθ`" are both used only through *two* properties: distinct labels are
  separated (which is what the count uses) and every body is close to some label (which is what
  the assignment uses). Both are exactly what a maximum-cardinality `¬R`-pairwise subset of a
  `Finset` gives, and taking the net inside the finite set of *occurring* normals and offsets —
  rather than over the whole sphere and the whole line — removes the only genuinely infinite
  object from the construction.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.card_le_of_pairwise_sep_of_mem_Icc` — **the one-dimensional lattice
  count**: a `σ`-separated finite set of reals inside an interval of length `ℓ` has at most
  `ℓ/σ + 1` elements. This is the `⌈C/c⌉ + 1` factor of GWZ, and the `+1` is exactly the
  `+1` in the cone-count clause (S4″).
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lineAngle_defining_normal_le_of_axisAngle_le` — **the measured
  obstruction to the pinned comparison constant**. A cell of the construction is
  `generalSlab c ν _ R ratio` for a *net* normal `ν`, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyNormal` of
  that cell is only within `2 ratio` of `ν`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lineAngle_bodyNormal_generalSlab_le`; it is not equal to it, because
  `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal` is read off the outer prism, which is not canonical for a
  spheroid). Clause `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab.angle_ratio` gives
  `∠(n(W), n(S)) ≤ 2 (a/b)`, so the alignment against the *defining* normal — the one the
  transport `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabRescale c ν …` stretches, and the one
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_slabRescale_image_of_aligned` consumes — is
  `2 (a/b) + 2 ratio`, which is **strictly more than `2 (a/b)` for every positive `ratio`**.
  Since `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage.rescale` is pinned at
  `latticeRescaleConstant bd.C₀`, no lattice cell family can discharge it at that constant:
  the pin has to move to `alignedRescaleConstant bd.C₀ κ` for some `κ > 2` (with
  `ratio = (a/b)/4`, which is what `4 ≤ bd.C₀` buys in clause (S2), `κ = 5/2` suffices). This
  is a *statement* question, not a proof gap, and it is recorded here rather than forced.

/-! ### The tilted-width estimate -/

/-- **The alignment estimate on the first frame vector**, the companion of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.abs_inner_middle_le_of_lineAngle_le` at index `0`.

Same proof, same reason: `e₀ ⊥ e₂`, so Bessel's identity in the orthonormal frame gives
`⟪n, e₀⟫² ≤ 1 - ⟪n, e₂⟫² = sin²∠(e₂, n)`, and `sin x ≤ x`. Together the two say that a bound on
the *normal* angle bounds the component of `n` along **both** long frame vectors, which is what
the tilted-width estimate needs. -/

/-- **The half-width of a body in a tilted direction.**

For `x` in the body and `c₀` the centre of its outer prism, the component of `x - c₀` along a
unit direction `n` decomposes in the prism's frame as
`⟪n, x - c₀⟫ = Σ_k ⟪n, e_k⟫ ⟪e_k, x - c₀⟫`, where `|⟪e_k, x - c₀⟫| ≤ τ_k` by
`Kakeya.outerPrism.basis_repr_le`. If the body's normal is within `κ` of `n`, the two long
coefficients are at most `κ` (`abs_inner_first_le_of_lineAngle_le`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.abs_inner_middle_le_of_lineAngle_le`) and the short one is at most `1`,
which gives `κ (τ₀ + τ₁) + τ₂`. -/

/-! ### The greedy net, over the finite set of occurring labels -/

/-- **The net, in the only form the construction uses.** For a finite set `X` and a *reflexive
symmetric* "closeness" relation `R`, there is a subset `P ⊆ X` whose distinct elements are
pairwise **not** `R`-close and such that every element of `X` is `R`-close to some element of
`P`.

That is exactly what the source's two nets are used for: "a fixed `cθ`-net of unoriented normal
directions" and "a lattice of spacing `cθ` in the coordinate `⟨x,ν⟩`"
(GWZ) enter the proof only through
*separation of the labels* — which is what the `O(1)` slab-label count of  uses —
and *density at the occurring points* — which is what the assignment of  uses.
Taking the net inside the finite set of occurring labels rather than over the whole sphere and
the whole line removes the only infinite object from the construction and costs nothing: the
separation is the same and the density is needed only where a body sits.

The proof is the maximum-cardinality subset: if some `j ∈ X` were `R`-far from all of `P`, then
`insert j P` would still be pairwise-not-`R` (symmetry) and strictly larger. -/

/-! ### The one-dimensional lattice count -/

/-- **A `σ`-separated finite set of reals inside an interval of length `ℓ` has at most
`ℓ/σ + 1` elements.**

This is the `⌈C/c⌉ + 1` factor of the source's `O(1)` slab-label count: for a fixed net normal
`ν` the cells are the lattice translates in the coordinate `⟨x, ν⟩`, their offsets are
`σ`-separated by construction, and the ones whose thickened cell contains a given point have
their offsets inside one interval of length `2 (C θ + C₀ a)`. The `+1` is the reason the
licensed clause (S4″) reads `(α/(a/b) + 1)²` and not `(α/(a/b))²`.

The map `t ↦ ⌊(t - A)/σ⌋` is injective on a `σ`-separated set, because two reals with the same
floor differ by less than `1`; and it lands in `{0, …, ⌊ℓ/σ⌋}`. -/

/-! ### The measured obstruction: the pinned comparison constant `latticeRescaleConstant bd.C₀` -/


/-! ### Clause (S2) for a cell of tangential radius `4 r₁` -/

/-- **The tangential over-reach of a lattice cell costs exactly `4 ≤ C₀`.**

The source's cells have "two fixed tangential widths **large enough to contain `B₁`**"
(GWZ) — they are not inside the ball,
they contain it. The smallest radius at which the cell of a body of `B̄(ctr B, r₁)` still
contains that body after a lattice offset of up to `r₁` is `4 r₁` (the offset alone moves the
centre by `r₁`, so the reach must exceed `2 r₁`, and `4 r₁` is the round value at which the
tangential term of the ellipsoid is `≤ 1/4`, leaving room for the normal term).

A cell of tangential radius `4 r₁` has exact tangential thickness `4 r₁`, and clause (S2) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily` asks for the profile `(r₁, r₁, (a/b) r₁)` at the comparison
constant `bd.C₀`. The two agree exactly when `4 ≤ bd.C₀` — which is the first of the two side
conditions  recorded, here **located at its use** and not merely
asserted. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData` supplies only `1 ≤ bd.C₀`, so this is a binder of the
producer; the boundary's own tripwires already carry `hC₀bd : 4 ≤ C₀bd`. -/

/-! ### Clause (S3): a tilted body lies inside its lattice cell -/

/-- **Containment by construction** — the clause (S3) half of the lattice assignment.

A cell is the ellipsoid `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.generalSlab (z + t ν) ν _ R ratio` of tangential
semi-axis `R` and normal half-width `ratio · R` about a point of the axis `z + ℝν`. A body that
(i) lies in the ball `B̄(z, R/4)`, so its distance to the cell's centre is at most `R/2`, and
(ii) has all its points within `h` of the cell's central plane in the coordinate `⟨ν, ·⟩`, with
`2 h ≤ ratio · R`, lies in the cell: by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.norm_sq_aniLin` the normalised
norm squared is `R⁻²(‖v‖² − ⟪ν,v⟫²) + (ratio R)⁻² ⟪ν,v⟫² ≤ 1/4 + 1/4 ≤ 1`.

Hypothesis (ii) is what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.abs_inner_sub_le_of_aligned` supplies for a body
whose normal is close to `ν` and whose offset is close to `t`: the source's "assign a plank to
the first slab whose normal is closest to its short John axis and whose **normal interval
contains it**" is exactly this pair of conditions, and this lemma is the step
that turns them into the tree's containment clause. -/

/-! ### The count of a two-level net inside a cone — the engine of clause (S4″) -/

/-- **`O(1)` slab labels at a point, counted.**

This is the source's count of  — "at a shaded point, the typical-angle property
confines all relevant normals to one `O(θ)`-cap; separation of the normal net and of the
one-dimensional lattice therefore leaves only `O(1)` possible slab labels" — stated for the
abstract two-level net the lattice construction produces, and proved.

A label carries a **normal** `nrm i` and an **offset** `off i`, and the construction's
separation is exactly the hypothesis `hsep`: two distinct labels either sit on different net
normals, which are `ε`-separated, or on the *same* net normal, in which case their lattice
offsets are `σ`-separated. Restricting to the labels whose normal lies in the `α`-cone about
`v` and whose offset lies in an interval of length `ℓ` — which is what "the thickened cell
contains `x`" gives — the count is at most

`C_{lem:coneDirectionCount} (α/ε)² · (ℓ/σ + 1)`,

the product of the number of net cells in the cap (`Kakeya.NonSlab.card_le_coneDirectionCount`,
applied to the *image* of `nrm`, which is `ε`-separated) and the number of lattice translates
per normal (`card_le_of_pairwise_sep_of_mem_Icc`, applied fibrewise). Both factors are `δ`-free
once `ε ∝ a/b`, `σ ∝ (a/b) r₁` and `ℓ ∝ (a/b) r₁`, and the shape `(α/ε)²·(ℓ/σ + 1)` is exactly
the licensed clause (S4″)'s `slabConeCountConstant · (α/(a/b) + 1)²` after those
substitutions. -/

/-- **Clause (A2′) is a consequence of clause (A2) — the R7 obligation dissolves.**

The existing (A2′) producer `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_slabRescale_cthickening_of_aligned`
carries the alignment of the **thickened** body's own normal as a hypothesis, and that hypothesis
— "R7", `∠(n(N_r W), n(W)) ≲ r/τ₁(W)` — was the last piece of geometry the tangential package
owed. It is **not needed**: (A2′) follows from (A2) by two facts about thickenings and nothing
about normals at all.

* *Lower halves*: `X ⊆ N_r(X)`, so the images nest and `Metric.thickness` is monotone
  (`Kakeya.Metric.thickness_monotone`); the lower bound at `Cmp` is therefore inherited at the
  weaker constant `2 Cmp`.
* *Upper halves*: `L(N_r(X)) ⊆ N_{Mr}(L(X))` with `M = max α β`
  (`aniRescale_image_cthickening_subset`), and thickening a set by `s` raises each thickness by
  at most `s` (`Kakeya.Metric.thickness_cthickening_le`). So
  `τ_k(L(N_r X)) ≤ τ_k(L X) + M r ≤ Cmp t_k + M r`, and the hypothesis `hslack : M r ≤ Cmp t_k`
  closes it at `2 Cmp t_k`.

At the tangential instance `M r = (b/(a r₁)) · τ₂(W) ≤ (b/(a r₁)) · C₀ a = C₀ (b/r₁) = C₀ ρ₂`,
while `Cmp t_k` is `Cmp` at `k = 0` and `Cmp ρ₂` at `k = 1, 2`, so `hslack` is exactly
`C₀ ≤ Cmp` together with `ρ₂ ≤ 1` — both available (`le_alignedRescaleConstant`). **The factor
`2` of the existing clause (A2′) is thereby explained**: it is the one thickening step, not a
second alignment loss. -/

set_option maxHeartbeats 2000000 in
-- The construction carries two greedy nets, a choice function for each, and six clause proofs
-- in one term; the `S4″` fibration alone exhausts the default budget.
/-- **`hfam` — the tangential slab family at a general `(a, b)`, constructed.**

This is the producer  specified and did not build, and it is the refined
source's own construction (GWZ: boundary-safe form ) with the two nets taken *inside the finite set of occurring
labels* rather than over the sphere and the line:

* a `κ(a/b)`-net of normals at mesh `ε = (a/b)/(32 C₀)`, produced by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_maximal_pairwise_not` on the finite set
  `{n(W_j) : j ∈ 𝕎''_B}` — separated by construction, and dense **where a body sits**, which is
  all the assignment needs;
* for each net normal, a lattice of offsets at spacing `σ = (a/b) r₁/4` in the coordinate
  `⟨x, ν⟩` only, by the same lemma;
* the cell of a label `m` is the ellipsoid
  `generalSlab (ctr B + ⟨ν, w_m − ctr B⟩ ν) ν _ (4 r₁) ((a/b)/4)`, of tangential semi-axis
  `4 r₁` — "two fixed tangential widths large enough to contain `B₁`" — and normal
  half-width exactly `(a/b) r₁`;
* `slabOf j` is the cell of the label the two nets assign to `j`: "the first slab whose normal
  is closest to its short John axis and whose normal interval contains it".

All six clauses hold **by construction**: (S2)-profile by
`latticeCell_hasThicknesses` (the `4 ≤ bd.C₀` side condition, located there), (S2)-ball by the
cell's own centre, (S3)-containment by `subset_generalSlab_of_normal_bound` fed by the
tilted-width estimate `abs_inner_sub_le_of_aligned` (the `16 C₀ b ≤ r₁` side condition, a
`∀ᶠ δ` threshold on the tangential path, enters exactly here), (S3)-angle and (S3′) by the net
mesh plus `lineAngle_bodyNormal_generalSlab_le`, and **(S4″) by `card_le_cone_lattice`** — the
source's `O(1)`-slab-labels count, at the `δ`-free `slabConeCountConstant`.

The two extra data returned, `nrmOf` and `ctrOf` with the shape equation, are what the (A1) and
(A2) producers of `MainLemma2/TangentialSlabAlign.lean` consume; see
`exists_slabPackageData_lattice`. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hasThicknesses_slabRescale_image_of_aligned` is general in the radius and
the aspect, so it applies once two `δ`-free bookkeeping moves are made: the body's profile
`(r₁, b, a)` at `bd.C₀` is read as `(8 r₁, 8 b, 4 a)` at `8 bd.C₀` — the doubled cell's radius
is `8 r₁`, and the conclusion's middle entry `8 b/(8 r₁) = ρ₂` is unchanged — and the
alignment is read at the cell's aspect, `κ · ratio = κ (a/b)/2`, so the `3 (a/b)` that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab.angle_ratio` (`2 (a/b)`) and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lineAngle_bodyNormal_generalSlab_le` (`(a/b)`) supply needs `6 ≤ κ`.

/-! ### The tangential slab package at a general `(a, b)`, and conjunct 3 -/

set_option maxHeartbeats 1000000 in
-- Four clause producers in one term, each carrying the cell's shape through `hshape`.
/-- **`exists_slabPackage_general` with binders `{hCμ, hCΔ}`** — conjunct 3's conclusion,
obtained by doubling the normalization cell: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabPackage.L` is a
free field, so the producer normalises the **doubled** cell. The cell then lands in `B̄(0,1/2)`
and the bodies' `τ₂`-neighbourhoods still land in `B̄(0,1)`, so clause (A1′) holds for **every**
`Wd` and **no statement moves anywhere** — neither a margin clause on
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab` (option R-a) nor a radius `2` in the binder (option R-b,
rejected: it would force the unit-ball convention of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.KTRho2ScaleDataAt`, hence conjunct 4 a third time).

Beyond the two constant thresholds the theorem takes exactly the three side conditions this
file isolates: `4 ≤ bd.C₀` (the cell's tangential radius), `32 C₀ b ≤ r₁` (a
`∀ᶠ δ` threshold, which also supplies route R-c's `C₀ b ≤ 2 r₁`), and the margin
`N_{τ₂(W_j)}(W_j) ⊆ B̄(ctr B, r₁)` that the existing degenerate producer already takes. -/
