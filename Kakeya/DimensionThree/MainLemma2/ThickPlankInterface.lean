# The Section 6 plank interface required by the thick case of Main Lemma 2

The thick case of Main Lemma 2 (blueprint `lem:ml2thickDensity`, Lean
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody`) rests on material that Section 6 owns and that is
not formalized: the Frostman estimate for planks and the presentation of
a thick-case block as a family of planks in the unit ball.

Three theorems:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolume` — blueprint `plankF`, volume form
  `eq:plankF-volume`. It is stated so
  as to be a reduction to the Section 6 statement `Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate`,
  which is GWZ Lemma 6.4 itself: the non-concentration hypothesis is now Section 6's
  `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated` at an exported dilation `C_NC`, verbatim. An earlier
  version of this file stated it at the *aligned* count of blueprint
  `eq:plank-thickening-nonconcentration` and derived it from `plankEstimate`; that derivation
  was **not available**, because the aligned hypothesis does not imply the dilated one at any
  constant — see the counterexample in the module docstring of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/FrostmanPlankReduction.lean` and the second deviation bullet of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt`;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_thickFullBlock` — blueprint `lem:ml2thickBlockSelect`. **Proved**, from the per-segment density hypothesis (C5)
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_density`, which descends to a block for free;
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.denseInBodyRaw_of_thickPlankPresentation` — blueprint
  `lem:ml2thickPlankF`, the assembly. **Proved**, from the arithmetic of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThickPlankAux.lean` together with the parameter budget
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable`, which it takes as a hypothesis and which
  reaches it from the field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankF`.

What Section 6 still owes — blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank` together with
`lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` and `lem:ml2thickMbound`, bundled as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation` — is deliberately *not* a theorem of this file.
It is the predicate `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable`, which the thick case carries
as a hypothesis at the *same* comparison constant as its parameter budget; the reason is the
quantifier order discussed below, and the hypothesis reaches its consumers from the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankPres`.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBodyRaw` then combines them, and is proved; and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody` in
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThickCase.lean` is derived from it, together with the
already-proved thick-case counting material, by the exponent bookkeeping of blueprint
`def:ml2thickGain`. Nothing in this file strengthens or modifies any statement of Section 6:
`Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.plankEstimate` (the *multiplicity* form of GWZ Lemma 6.1) is left
untouched, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolume` is a separate, usable rendering of
GWZ Lemma 6.4, now at Section 6's own non-concentration hypothesis.

## The two invariants the statements have to make visible

Both are quantifier-order properties, and both are stated rather than merely described,
because prose cannot be consumed by a proof.

**Uniformity.** One constant per exponent must serve every ball `B ∈ 𝔅`, every body
`W ∈ 𝕎_B`, every plank `P ∈ 𝒫` and every thickening parameter `θ ∈ [a/b, 1]`. A constant
depending on the ball centre, on the body or on `θ` would make the reduction of blueprint
`lem:ml2goalfromdens` circular, exactly as recorded for
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`. This is why
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable` quantifies the ball and the body — and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation.nonconcentration` the parameter `θ` — *under* one
fixed pair `(CP, Θ)`, instead of producing a pair for each of them.

**One triple `(CP, Θ, C_NC)`, quantified once and shared with the budget.** All three are
data, for the same reason. `CP` and `Θ` occur on the
*large* side of the presentation and on the *small* side of the parameter budget:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable bd CP Θ` gets weaker as they grow, while
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable bd τ CP` gets stronger, both of its thresholds
`CP δ/a ≤ b₀` and `(CP δ/b)^{η_{plankF}} ≤ c₁ δ^{2η}` failing once `CP` is large. So neither may
be quantified inside the other, and neither may be pinned to a value:

* a *universally* quantified budget, `∀ CP ≥ 1, PlankFrostmanUsable bd τ CP`, is refutable at
  any fixed configuration, by taking `CP` large;
* an *existentially* quantified presentation, `∃ CP Θ ≥ 1, ThickPlankPresentable bd CP Θ`, is
  useless, because its witness is then not available to the budget;
* Naming two `opaque` constants with only the property `1 ≤ ·` does not
  provide the quantitative estimates. The presentation at such a value is neither provable nor refutable: at
  `CP = Θ = 1` the comparability fields `short_lower`–`long_upper` collapse to the exact
  equalities `a' = δ/b`, `b' = δ/a`, `fullness_ge` and `sel_card` to exact identities and
  `frostman` to the bare `C_bias`, none of which the enclosing planks satisfy, while no proof
  may appeal to
  `1 < CP` either. An *independent* statement is strictly worse than an open one.

The dilation `C_NC` of the non-concentration hypothesis is in exactly the same position, and
this is why it is exported rather than bound inside either side.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation.nonconcentration` gets *stronger* as `C_NC` grows,
`Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated` being a demand about a larger container, while
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable` gets *weaker*, that same predicate being its
hypothesis. So a value quantified inside either one is unusable to the other, and it must be
data too.

The arrangement that works, and the one recorded here, is that `CP`, `Θ` and `C_NC` are
**data**, quantified once and ahead of everything they constrain, and that the *same* triple
carries both the presentation and the budget: the fields
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.CP`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.Θ` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.C_NC`, with
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankPres` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankF` asserted at that one triple. It is
satisfiable — take them to be the geometric constants `C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)` and
`C_{lem:ml2thickMbound}(C₀)` of blueprint `def:ml2thickPlankConstant` and
`def:ml2thickMboundConstant`, functions of the thickness comparison constant of (C3)–(C4) and
of the ambient dimension alone, for which the two budget thresholds hold once `δ` is small —
and, unlike a sealed constant, it commits to no particular value.

**Dependence on the uniformity constant.** Writing the two constants as functions
of `bd.C₀` alone does not imply that their values are independent of `δ`. That claim is true of the *function* `C₀ ↦ C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)` and false of the
*value* it takes here. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.C₀` carries only `1 ≤ C₀`, and `bd` —
hence `bd.C₀`, hence any function of it — is produced *inside* the `∀ᶠ δ` of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData`, so no Lean statement here forbids it from
varying with `δ`. What the arrangement above guarantees is the property the budget actually
needs, and that property mentions no `δ`-freeness: for each `δ` the pair `(CP, Θ)` is chosen
*once*, before the ball, the body and `θ`, and is shared. That the smallness threshold on `δ`
which results is uniform in the parameters — which is what makes
`exists_setup_caseSideData` non-vacuous — is a property of the construction of `bd`, recorded
in the note at the end of blueprint subsection `thickCaseSection`; it is an obligation of that
construction and is asserted by no declaration in this file.

**The bias constant is not `δ`-free, and is therefore explicit in both fields that carry it.**
Blueprint `def:factmaxbiasConstant` and the field docstring of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.Cbias` both record that `C_{lemmafactmaxbias}` depends on
`cfg.δ` and on the cardinality of the family; GWZ p. 39 derives the value of `M` through `⪅`,
which by the convention of GWZ p. 3 hides a factor `C_ε δ^{-ε}`; and blueprint
`def:ml2thickMboundConstant` says in as many words that
`C_{lem:ml2thickMbound} = C_{lem:ml2thickCard}(C₀)² C_{lemmafactmaxbias}
(2³ C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)⁴/|B₁|)²` depends on `δ` through `C_{lemmafactmaxbias}`, and that
it is the constant blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlankF` consumes as its parameter `Θ`. In this
development the `δ`-dependent factor is exactly the field `bd.Cbias`, and it enters only
through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.biasedDensity` of (C4), which is the sole source of the
gain `(|K_θ|/|W|)^ϱ`. So `bd.Cbias` appears as an *explicit factor* in both constant-carrying
fields of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation`: in `frostman`, where it always did,
and in `nonconcentration`. Omitting this factor and using only a `δ`-independent
`Θ` would not follow from (C4). With the
factor explicit, `Θ` is the remaining quantity that blueprint `def:ml2thickMboundConstant`
names, and the field is derivable in principle.

/-- **The Frostman estimate for planks, volume form, at prescribed parameters** (blueprint
`plankF`, display `eq:plankF-volume`; GWZ Lemma 6.4).

Every finite family `𝒫 = (P_i)_{i ∈ s}` of `a × b × 1` planks in `B_1` with shading `Y`, with
`0 < a ≤ b ≤ b₀`, pairwise essentially distinct, of fullness `λ(𝒫, Y) ≥ a^η`, of Frostman
constant `C_F(𝒫) ≤ C_F` *in the unit ball*, and satisfying the non-concentration bound
`|{j ∈ s : P_j ⊆ C_NC · (P_i)_θ}| ≤ M θ` for every `i ∈ s` and every `a/b ≤ θ ≤ 1` at some
`M ≥ 1`, obeys

`a^ε C_F^{β/2-1} b^{2β} (M^{-1} b² |s|)^{β/2} ≤ 64 |U(𝒫, Y)|`.

The parameters `η`, `b₀` and the non-concentration dilation `C_NC` are explicit here, rather
than existentially bound as in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolume`, because
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.denseInBodyRaw_of_thickPlankPresentation` has to compare them with the
scales of the configuration: its two threshold hypotheses are inequalities between `b₀`, `η`
and `cfg.δ`, `cfg.a`, `cfg.b`, `cfg.η`, and an existentially bound witness cannot appear in a
hypothesis.

Three deliberate deviations from the blueprint display, each a weakening:

* the Frostman constant is an upper bound `C_F` supplied by the caller rather than the
  extremal `Kakeya.frostmanConstant` of the family. Since `β/2 - 1 < 0` and `C_F ≥ 1`, the
  displayed factor is *decreasing* in the constant, so the version with an upper bound is
  implied by the version with the extremal one; and it is the version the thick case can use,
  because blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank`(iii) supplies only an upper bound;
* the non-concentration hypothesis is the **dilated** one,
  `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated s 𝒫 C_NC M`, i.e. the count is taken over the planks
  contained in the `C_NC`-dilation `(P_i)_θ.dilation C_NC` of the standard `θ`-thickening, and
  *not* over those contained in `(P_i)_θ` itself. This is a **strengthening of the hypothesis**,
  hence a weakening of the estimate, and it is a genuine departure from blueprint `plankF`,
  whose display `eq:plank-thickening-nonconcentration` is the aligned count
  `|{j : P_j ⊆ (P_i)_θ}| ≤ M θ`. The departure is forced, and it is Section 6's, not this
  file's: `Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate` — the Section 6 rendering of GWZ Lemma 6.4,
  and the only source from which a volume lower bound is available here — takes exactly
  `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated s (fun i => (V i).toPrism3D) C_NC M`, because its proof
  routes through the representative-fibre bound
  `Plank.ThickenedRepr.card_fibre_le_of_nonconcentration`, whose geometry sees a fibre only
  from inside a fixed dilation of one of its members
  (`Plank.ThickenedRepr.fibre_subset_dilated_thickening`, at
  `C_NC = Plank.ThickenedRepr.fibreDilation cThk = (1 + 2 cThk) cThk ≥ 3`).

  The aligned form does **not** imply the dilated one, and this is not a gap in the search for
  a proof: the module docstring of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/FrostmanPlankReduction.lean`
  exhibits a family of `a × b × 1` planks that is pairwise essentially distinct, lies in the
  working window, satisfies the aligned count at *every* `θ ∈ [a/b, 1]` with the least
  admissible `M = b/a`, and whose dilated count at `C = 3` is `(θ b / 2a)²`, a ratio
  `θ b / 4a` above `M θ` that is unbounded. The structural reason is that the aligned
  thickening `(P_i)_θ` widens only the *thin* axis, while `PrismNDim.dilation C` widens all
  three — in particular the *unit-length* long axis, along which `Plank.thickenedNbhd P θ`
  reaches only `1 + θ b`. So no restatement of this predicate at the aligned hypothesis is
  derivable from Section 6, at any constant; only the dilated one is. The dilation factor is
  therefore exported as a parameter, and every producer of the hypothesis — here
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation.nonconcentration` — has to supply it at that
  same `C_NC`. This distinction is relevant when comparing `plankF` with
  `eq:plank-thickening-nonconcentration`.

  Note also that this is a different hypothesis from the slab-family bound
  `Plank.inSlabFamily` of the multiplicity form `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.plankEstimate`
  (GWZ Lemma 6.1), which is not usable here for the reason given on
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolume`;
* the factor `64` on the volume side, used in the arithmetic of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThickPlankAux.lean`. It is a fixed
  numeral, independent of every parameter, and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBodyRaw` absorbs it into the constant it produces.

**Localization and the Frostman window are both taken at radius `Plank.windowRadius = 4`, not
at the unit ball.** Blueprint `plankF` states the estimate for planks in `B₁`, and an earlier
version of this predicate copied that literally; but the planks the thick case can actually
produce are *enclosing* planks of the images `L(T_p)`, and an enclosing plank of a body in
`B̄(0,1)` is only known to lie in `B̄(0, 4)` — that is exactly what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure` delivers, and why
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankBallRadius` is defined from `Plank.windowRadius`. So the
localization hypothesis is `Plank.IsWindowedFamily`, which is the hypothesis of
`Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate` itself, and the Frostman hypothesis is taken in
`Kakeya.plankWindow` for the same reason: with the planks outside `B₁` there is no longer a
`Kakeya.ConvexSpaceBody.IsFrostmanIn.change_ambient` step available to convert a unit-ball
Frostman bound into a plank-window one, since that conversion needs the bodies to lie in the
unit ball. Both changes make this predicate *weaker*, and both are what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation` can honestly supply.

Note that the middle plank scale of the thick case is `b = δ/a` up to the comparison constant
`CP`, so the container `((P)_θ).dilation C_NC` — whose half-widths are `C_NC` times those of
the `θ`-thickening, i.e. `(C_NC a, C_NC θ b, C_NC)` at the plank's *own* half-widths — is
comparable to the `N_{θ δ/a}(P)` of blueprint `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` up to `C_NC` and that
same constant; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation.nonconcentration` for the
reconciliation and for the extra powers of `C_NC` that `Θ` has to absorb. The name `b` of this
predicate and the working scale `cfg.b` of the thick case are unrelated. -/

/-- **The Frostman estimate for planks, volume form** (blueprint `plankF`, display
`eq:plankF-volume`; GWZ Lemma 6.4): for some non-concentration dilation `C_NC ≥ 1` and suitable
`η > 0` and `b₀ > 0`, the estimate `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` holds.

This is a *predicate*, so that the whole statement — including its `∃ C_NC`, `∃ η`, `∃ b₀` —
can be handed around as a hypothesis; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` for the
content and for the four deviations from the blueprint display.

**The binder order mirrors `Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate`**, whose statement is
`∃ C_NC, 1 ≤ C_NC ∧ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ η > 0, ∃ b₀ > 0, …`: the dilation is quantified *outermost*,
ahead of `ε`, because Section 6 produces it once, from the representative geometry of blueprint
`lemmaredplanktube`, before any exponent is chosen. Here `ε` is a parameter rather than a
binder, so `C_NC` simply comes first. Keeping the order is what lets
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolume` be a reduction to that statement rather than a
re-derivation of it. -/

/-- **The Frostman estimate for planks** (blueprint `plankF`, GWZ Lemma 6.4), in the volume
form `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolume`.

This is intended to be *derived*, and not assumed, from the Section 6 statement
`Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate` of
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/FrostmanPlankEstimate.lean`, which is GWZ Lemma 6.4 itself and
whose first conjunct is exactly the volume lower bound.

With `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` now carrying the *dilated* non-concentration
hypothesis at an exported `C_NC`, the bookkeeping between the two is purely a matter of types,
and costs nothing:

* the dilation `C_NC` and its bound `1 ≤ C_NC` are the outermost existential on both sides, in
  the same order; the hypothesis `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated s (fun i => (V i).toPrism3D)
  C_NC Mn` is the Section 6 one verbatim, with the same argument order and the same `ℝ≥0`-valued
  count and parameter, so no conversion is needed. In contrast, the aligned count
  `|{j ∈ s : P_j ⊆ Plank.thickenedNbhd (P_i) θ}| ≤ M θ` of blueprint
  `eq:plank-thickening-nonconcentration`, and the bridge from Section 6 to it is not merely
  unproved but **false** — see the second deviation bullet of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt`, and the counterexample in the module docstring
  of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/FrostmanPlankReduction.lean`;
* windowing and the Frostman window are the Section 6 ones on the nose — `Plank.IsWindowedFamily`
  and `Kakeya.plankWindow` — since `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` was restated at
  radius `Plank.windowRadius = 4`, which is `Kakeya.plankWindowRadius` by `rfl`; see its
  docstring for why the unit-ball form is not what the thick case can supply;
* the Frostman constant is an `NNReal` here and an `ENNReal` with `CF ≠ ⊤` there;
* the middle scale appears as `b ^ (2 : ℝ)` here and as `b ^ 2` there, bridged by
  `ENNReal.rpow_two`;
* the factor `64` on the volume side of `PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` is now pure slack: it used to
  pay for `Kakeya.ConvexSpaceBody.IsFrostmanIn.change_ambient`, which is no longer needed, and
  is retained only so that the downstream arithmetic of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThickPlankAux.lean` is unchanged.

Not usable here, by contrast, is the multiplicity form `Kakeya.KatzTaoEstimate.plankEstimate`
of GWZ Lemma 6.1: its conclusion bounds `μ(𝒫, Y)` from above rather than `|U(𝒫, Y)|` from
below, and its non-concentration hypothesis is the slab-family bound of blueprint
`eq:plank-slab-nonconcentration` rather than a thickened-plank containment at all.

The hypothesis `hKF` is the Frostman estimate `K_F(β)` of blueprint `def:KF`; in the thick
case it is supplied by the field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fEstimate` of the configuration. -/

/-- **A plank-Frostman exponent at which the estimate is available**.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolume` supplies its exponent existentially, but the thick
case has to *name* it: the exponent must be fixed before `cfg.η` is, since the parameter budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.budget` — `2η < τ η_{plankF}` — compares the two,
and `η` is the quantity the parameter lemma `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams` chooses
last. This is that name: the exponent the estimate itself provides, defaulting to `1` when the
estimate is unavailable, so that it is positive *unconditionally* and hence usable in
`exists_caseParams`, which does not see `K_F(β)`.

**Why a canonical exponent and not a free parameter.**
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` gets *stronger* as the exponent grows: its
fullness hypothesis `a^{η_{plankF}} ≤ λ(𝒫, Y)` weakens, `a` being at most `1`. So the estimate
holds only up to some maximal exponent and is false above it, while the second threshold of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable` asks for the exponent to be *large*. A budget stated
against a free exponent parameter would therefore be no budget at all: it would be met by
taking that parameter huge, and at such a value the estimate — hence the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankF` — is false. Comparing `η` against an
exponent at which the estimate is *known* to hold is what makes that field satisfiable.

It is `@[irreducible]`: the body is a `dite` on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolume`, a
large universally quantified proposition carrying a `Classical.propDecidable` instance, and
nothing outside the two lemmas below has any use for the body. Without the attribute every
`whnf` reaching this term — for instance inside the `min` that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams` builds `η` from — tries to reduce that `dite` and
exhausts the heartbeat budget. The two lemmas below still see the body, through the equation
lemmas. -/

/-- **Section 6 interface stub: choosing a full block of the factoring**.

There are a ball `B ∈ 𝔅` and a segment `T_B ∈ 𝕋_B` whose block `𝕋_{B,W}`, `W = W(T_B)`,
inherits the fullness of `𝕋_B`, hence the fullness `λ(𝕋_B, Y_B) ≥ c₁ δ^{2η}` of (C5):

`c₁ δ^{2η} ≤ λ(𝕋_{B,W}, Y_B)`.

The body is presented through a segment `T_B` of its own block rather than as a body
`W ∈ 𝕎_B` on the nose. That is not a convenience: a body of `𝕎_B` may have an *empty* block,
and every quantitative statement about the block below — the fullness here, the cardinality
bound `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPcard_ge`, the plank presentation — is false for it. Choosing
the block through one of its members rules that out once and for all, and the body is then
`bd.blk p₀`, which lies in `bd.bodies B` by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.blk_mem`.

**The proof does not need the mass regrouping of blueprint `lem:ml2thickMassRegroup`.** That
regrouping — `λ(𝕋_B, Y_B) ∑_{T_B ∈ 𝕋_B}|T_B| = ∑_{W' ∈ 𝕎_B} λ(𝕋_{B,W'}, Y_B) ∑_{T_B ∈
𝕋_{B,W'}}|T_B|`, followed by a pigeonhole over `𝕎_B` — is how the blueprint argues, and every
ingredient of it is in fact available: blueprint `lem:ml2multFullness` is
`Kakeya.ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul`, proved and already cleared of
division, and `Kakeya.exists_sum_div_sum_le` is the mediant pigeonhole. But the development
states (C5) *per segment* rather than in the aggregate — the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_density` is `c₁ δ^{2η} |T_B| ≤ |Y_B(T_B)|` for each
`T_B ∈ 𝕋_B` — and a per-segment bound descends to an arbitrary subfamily for free. Summing it
over the block and dividing by the total carrier volume gives the fullness bound directly, so
*every* non-empty block of *every* ball already has fullness `≥ c₁ δ^{2η}`; the ball and the
segment are then chosen arbitrarily, by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.bs_nonempty` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_nonempty`.

The two side conditions of the division are the ones the `[0, ∞]`-valued
`ShadedBody.fullness` always needs: the total carrier volume of the block is finite, by
compactness of the carriers, and non-zero, because the block contains `T_B`, whose carrier has
positive volume: the thickness data (C3) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_thickness`
bounds each of the three affine thicknesses of `T_B` below by `C₀⁻¹ δ > 0`, and
`Convex.volume_pos_of_ethickness_ne_zero` turns that into `0 < |T_B|`. (The packaged form
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickSegVolRatio` says the same thing, but lives downstream of this
file.)

The constant `c₁` is the per-segment density constant of (C5) — the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.c₁`, positive by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.hc₁` — so no new constant is introduced and uniformity in `B`
and in `W` is automatic: `c₁` is one field of `bd`, not a function of the ball. -/

/-! ### The two constants of the thick-case plank presentation

Blueprint `def:ml2thickPlankConstant` and `def:ml2thickMboundConstant` introduce
`C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)` and `C_{lem:ml2thickMbound}(C₀)` by the properties they must have,
not by values: of the ingredients of the first only the volume one is explicit (`24√3 π`, from
`|B₁|/|L(W)| ≤ 2³|B₁|/(c|Q|)`), the other being the unproved alignment estimate behind
`lem:ml2thickPlank`(i), and two of the three factors of the second are likewise introduced by
their defining property.

They are therefore **not** rendered as Lean definitions. Neither a formula nor a sealed
`opaque` value would be honest: a formula would make the presentation at that value a *false*
statement, and a sealed value about which only `1 ≤ ·` is derivable would make it an
*independent* one, which is worse. They are instead carried as the quantified data `CP`, `Θ`
of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable`, fixed once by the fields
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.CP` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.Θ` and shared by
the presentation and the parameter budget. See the module docstring for why nothing weaker
works, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable` for the shape of the hypothesis.
-/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **The plank presentation of a thick-case block** (blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank`, together
with `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` and `lem:ml2thickMbound`).

The data of the change of variables `L` carrying the outer prism of the body `W = W_j` onto a
cube, applied to the block `𝕋_{B,W}` and its shading: a family `𝒫` of genuine `a' × b' × 1`
planks *enclosing* the images `L(T_p)`, with dimensions comparable to `(δ/b, δ/a)` within the
constant `CP`, localized in the Section 6 window `B̄(0, 4)`, together with a *selected
subfamily* `𝒫_sel` on which the planks are pairwise essentially distinct, retain the block
cardinality up to `CP`, retain the fullness of the block up to `CP`, are `CP C_bias`-Frostman
in the plank window, have shaded union comparing with that of the block, and are
non-concentrated at `M = Θ C_bias (δ/a)^{2+ϱ}|𝕋_{B,W}|` uniformly in the thickening parameter
`θ ∈ [a'/b', 1]` and in the plank.

**Why an enclosing family and a selected subfamily, and not the images themselves.** Both are
forced by the following geometric considerations.

* `L(T_p)` is a convex body, not a `Plank`. The only construction of a genuine `Plank` from it
  is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure`, which returns a plank *containing* it. Since
  `ShadedPlank extends Plank, ShadedBody`, the plank's carrier *is* the shaded body's carrier,
  so enclosing enlarges the denominator of `ShadedBody.fullness` and leaves the numerator
  alone: plank fullness is strictly *smaller* than block fullness, and the exact equality
  `λ(𝒫, Y_𝒫) = λ(𝕋_{B,W}, Y_B)` of blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank`(iv) — which is a statement
  about the *images* — is false for the planks in the direction this development needs, namely
  a lower bound on plank fullness. The field `fullness_ge` is therefore the enclosure-weakened
  one-sided form, at the constant `CP`; that is what
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureVolume` supplies and it is all
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPres_fullness_ge` needs.
* essential distinctness does *not* survive enclosure. It transports to the images
  (`Kakeya.isEssentiallyDistinct_image_frameScale`), but two essentially distinct bodies may
  have enclosing planks that are not essentially distinct, which is exactly why
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFamilyEnclosure` establishes it only on a subfamily selected by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilySelection`. So the structure carries that subfamily,
  `sel`, and states `windowed`, `essDistinct`, `fullness_ge`, `volume_le` and
  `nonconcentration` over it.

**What the selection costs, and that it is only a constant.** `plankSubfamilySelection`
retains a `Csel⁻¹` fraction of *any* nonnegative weight on the family, so at the weight `1` it
retains a `Csel⁻¹` fraction of the cardinality. That is the field `sel_card`, stated at the
one constant `CP`; the loss is a constant factor and nothing more, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.denseInBodyRaw_of_thickPlankPresentation` pays for it by one further
power of `CP` inside the non-concentration factor. In particular the cardinality bound
`hPcard` of blueprint `lem:ml2thickPcard`, which that lemma consumes to know `M ≥ 1`, is still
stated for the *block* and is untouched by the selection: the parameter `M` of
`nonconcentration` is still `Θ C_bias (δ/a)^{2+ϱ}|𝕋_{B,W}|`, with the block cardinality.

The two constants `CP` and `Θ` are *parameters* of this structure, and they stay parameters
all the way up: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable` quantifies `B` and `j` under a
fixed pair, and that pair is fixed once, ahead of the ball, the body and the thickening
parameter `θ`, by the fields `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.CP` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.Θ`, which the parameter budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable` shares. That is where uniformity lives; see the
module docstring for why the pair may be neither universally quantified, nor bound inside an
existential, nor named by a definition. The one quantity that is known to depend on `δ`, the
bias constant of blueprint `lemmafactmaxbias`, is not part of `CP` or `Θ` at all: it is the
explicit factor `bd.Cbias` in the fields `frostman` and `nonconcentration`.

Obligation (b) of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody` is discharged *in the statement*
by the choice to carry genuine `Plank`s together with the comparability fields
`short_lower`–`long_upper`, rather than the block itself: blueprint `plankF` wants planks, the
block consists of convex bodies whose affine thicknesses are merely comparable to
`(δ/b, δ/a, 1)`, and the bridge between them is asserted here — with the constant `CP`, which
is exactly blueprint `C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)` — rather than proved. It changes no exponent,
since it only enlarges `CP` and `Θ`.

All four comparabilities are nevertheless available as theorems, so what is missing is the
*assembly* and not any one estimate. `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/NormalisedThickness.lean`
proves `short_lower`–`long_upper` as
`Kakeya.thickness_two_prismNormalise_ge_const_of_subset`,
`Kakeya.thickness_one_prismNormalise_ge_const_of_subset` and their two `le` companions, at the
single constant `Kakeya.normalisedThicknessConstant C₀ = 192 C₀⁵`; the upper halves are also
available in the shape `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure` consumes, as
`Kakeya.exists_frame_spread_le` of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/Alignment.lean`. Likewise
`volume_le` is `Kakeya.volume_preimage_thickenedNbhd_inter_le` of
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/NormalisedVolume.lean`. The fields are still *asserted* here
rather than derived because this structure is carried as a hypothesis and no construction of it
is given; a construction would have all of the above in hand.

Obligation (c) of the same docstring, the anisotropic change of variables, enters through
`volume_le` and `fullness_ge`, the two places where `|L(E)| = |det L| |E|` is used, and it is
no longer open. `Kakeya.volume_affineImage` and the transport lemmas of `Kakeya/AffineMap.lean`
supply that identity for a general affine equivalence, and the two items that
`Kakeya/Homothety.lean` provided for homotheties only — the invariance of `maxDensity` and of
`IsEssentiallyDistinct`, which enter the fields `frostman` and `essDistinct` below — are
`Kakeya.maxDensity_affineImage` and `IsEssentiallyDistinct.image_affineEquiv` of
`Kakeya/AffineMap.lean`. All of them are equalities or equivalences, so the anisotropy of
`L` costs no constant and enlarges neither `CP` nor `Θ`. Note
that `volume_le` no longer carries a bare `|B₁|`: the constant is the volume of the ball
`B̄(0, Plank.windowRadius)` in which the whole presentation lives, which is `δ`-free and
depends on the ambient dimension alone. It is a weaker constant than `|B₁|` and is available
whether the normalising map is read as landing in `B̄(0,1)` (as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankRescaledFamily_subset_closedBall` gives for the homothety `L_B`) or
only in the window. -/

  false about the planks. `ShadedPlank extends Plank, ShadedBody`, so the plank's carrier is
  the shaded body's carrier and `λ = Σ|shade| / Σ|carrier|`; the enclosure enlarges every
  carrier and leaves every shade alone, so plank fullness is *smaller* than block fullness —
  the wrong way round for `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPres_fullness_ge`, which needs a lower
  bound on plank fullness. What the enclosure does give is a two-sided comparison of the
  carriers, `|P_p| ≤ C(C₀)|L(T_p)|` (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureVolume`), together

  conversion requiring the bodies to lie in the unit ball. Reading the bound in the window
  costs at most the volume ratio `|B₄|/|B₁| = 64`, a dimensional constant that `CP` absorbs.

  multiplies every volume by `|det L|`; the constant is therefore any `δ`-free upper bound for

  all of them.

  **The container is the `C_NC`-dilated thickened prism, not the neighbourhood `N_{θb'}(P)`.**
  The field is `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated sel 𝒫 C_NC M`, i.e.

  `|{q ∈ sel : P_q ⊆ ((P_p)_θ).dilation C_NC}| ≤ M θ`   for all `p ∈ sel`, `a'/b' ≤ θ ≤ 1`,

  where `(P_p)_θ = Plank.thickened (P_p) θ` is the prism of half-widths `(θ b', b', 1)` sharing
  `P_p`'s centre and axes, and `PrismNDim.dilation C_NC` multiplies **all three** half-widths by
  `C_NC`. This is what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` — hence
  `Kakeya.FrostmanEstimate.plankEstimate`, hence GWZ Lemma 6.4 as Section 6 renders it —
  consumes, and it is a *stronger* demand than blueprint
  `eq:plank-thickening-nonconcentration`, which counts only the planks inside `N_{θb'}(P_p)`
  itself. Making it that is not a choice: the aligned form does not imply the dilated one at any
  constant, by the counterexample in the module docstring of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/FrostmanPlankReduction.lean`, so a field stated at
  `Plank.thickenedNbhd` cannot feed the
  estimate at all. See the second deviation bullet of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt`.

  This field is *assumed*, not derived, so the strengthening adds no proof debt here; it moves
  debt to Section 6's geometry, which is where blueprint `lem:ml2thickMbound` will have to be
  proved. What it does cost is one further factor `C_NC³` inside `Θ`, and the arithmetic is
  worth recording because the constant is what `Θ` must absorb:

  * `|((P_p)_θ).dilation C_NC| = 8 C_NC³ θ (b')²`, by `PrismNDim.volume_carrier` on the
    half-widths `C_NC (θ b', b', 1)`. That is `C_NC³` times `|(P_p)_θ| = 8 θ (b')²`
    (`Plank.volume_thickened`). The different estimate
    `Kakeya.volume_thickenedNbhd_le` for `Plank.thickenedNbhd (P_p) θ` gives
    `|N_{θb'}(P_p)| ≤ 64 θ (b')²`, but does not establish this field,
    because `N_{θb'}(P_p)` is not the container being counted in. The correct route is the
    displayed prism volume, and it is *not* available from `volume_thickenedNbhd_le`: the
    dilation grows the *long* axis to half-width `C_NC ≥ 1`, whereas `N_{θb'}(P_p)` reaches only
    `1 + θ b'` there. The two containers are genuinely different sets and neither contains the
    other.
  * blueprint `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` is then applied to
    `K_θ = L^{-1}(((P_p)_θ).dilation C_NC) ∩ W` rather than to `L^{-1}(N_{θ δ/a}(P_p)) ∩ W`.
    That is legitimate for the same reason the change of radius already was: the proof of
    blueprint `lem:ml2thickMbound` uses `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` only through a bound of the
    shape `|K_θ|/|W| ≤ Λ₀ θ (δ/a)²` with `Λ₀ ≥ 1` free of `δ`, so it runs verbatim at
    `Λ₀ = C_NC³ · 384 C₀³ CP²` in place of `384 C₀³ CP²`, and the biased comparison
    `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.biasedDensity` of (C4) then supplies the gain
    `(|K_θ|/|W|)^ϱ`. Since that proof charges `Λ₀²` to the constant, `Θ` absorbs `C_NC⁶` — the
    cube from the three dilated half-widths, squared by the `ϱ`-absorption step of blueprint
    `lem:ml2thickPowerAbsorb`. All of it is `δ`-free and no exponent moves. `C_NC` is itself
    `δ`-free: Section 6 produces it ahead of `ε`, and it is
    `Plank.ThickenedRepr.fibreDilation cThk` for the geometric constant `cThk` of blueprint
    `lemmaredplanktube`.

  Nothing is ever thickened above parameter `1` and no comparison of radii is needed: the field
  is stated at the plank's *own* `b'`, which is only comparable to `δ/a` (`long_lower`,
  `long_upper`), and the consumer asks for exactly that. (Passing instead through
  `N_{θ'' δ/a}(P)` at `θ'' = min (C_P θ) 1` would fail:
  in the branch `C_P θ > 1` the containment needs `θ b' ≤ δ/a`, whereas `long_upper` gives only
  `θ b' ≤ C_P δ/a` — take `θ = 1` and `b'` at its permitted upper value `C_P δ/a`.) The lower end
  of the range is likewise only shifted by a constant: `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` uses `θ ≥ a/b`
  solely to conclude `θ δ/a ≥ δ/b`, and `θ ≥ a'/b' ≥ CP⁻²(a/b)` gives `θ δ/a ≥ CP⁻² δ/b`, a
  further two powers of `CP` that `Θ` absorbs as well.

  **The counting is over the selected subfamily `sel`, but the parameter `M` still carries the
  *block* cardinality** `|𝕋_{B,W}|`. Restricting the count only weakens the field, and keeping
  the block cardinality in `M` is what lets `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.one_le_thickM` be fed by
  blueprint `lem:ml2thickPcard` unchanged. The mismatch between `M`'s `|𝕋_{B,W}|` and the
  `|sel|` that `plankF` returns in its conclusion is exactly the field `sel_card`, and it costs
  one further power of `CP`.

  **The bias factor `bd.Cbias` is explicit, and is not part of `Θ`.** Blueprint
  `def:ml2thickMboundConstant` defines `C_{lem:ml2thickMbound}` as a product one of whose
  factors is `C_{lemmafactmaxbias}`, and says that the constant depends "through the latter, on
  `δ` and on the cardinality of the family". In this development that factor is `bd.Cbias`, and
  it enters through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.biasedDensity` of (C4), which is the only
  source of the gain `(|K_θ|/|W|)^ϱ` that the proof of `lem:ml2thickMbound` uses. Writing this
  field with a `δ`-free `Θ` alone asserts strictly
  more than (C4) gives and is not derivable from it.

  **The thickening parameter ranges over `[a'/b', 1]`, the plank aspect ratio, and not over
  `[a/b, 1]`.** `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated`, and hence
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt`, consumes the hypothesis for every `θ` above the
  aspect ratio of the planks it is applied to, which is `a'/b'`; and `a'/b'` is only comparable
  to `a/b`, within `CP²`, so the two ranges are different and the plank one is the larger.

  **`M` is an `ℝ≥0`, not an `ℝ≥0∞`.** That is `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated`'s convention,
  and agrees with Section 6. Finiteness is therefore automatic. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPlankF_apply` pushes the coercion into the
  `[0, ∞]`-valued arithmetic of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThickPlankAux.lean`, which is
  unchanged. -/

and blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlankF` does its arithmetic in `[0, ∞]`. These five lemmas are the
transport, and nothing else; they are named so that the two consumers below do not each repeat
the cast bookkeeping. -/

**Why the threshold carries an extra factor `CP`.** The enclosure makes the plank fullness
smaller than the block fullness, not equal to it (see
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation.fullness_ge`), so the chain has to pay `CP⁻¹`
somewhere. It is paid on the threshold, which is the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable`: that predicate now asks for
`CP (CP δ/b)^{η_{plankF}} ≤ c₁ δ^{2η}` rather than `(CP δ/b)^{η_{plankF}} ≤ c₁ δ^{2η}`. Under the
thick-case guard this is the same kind of smallness condition on `δ` as before — the left-hand

/-- **Section 6 interface: the thick-case blocks are plank families, at one pair of constants**
.

Every ball `B ∈ 𝔅` of the configuration and every block of a body `W ∈ 𝕎_B` presented through
one of its own segments `p₀` admits a `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation`, all of
them at the *same* pair `(CP, Θ)`.

**The quantifier order is the statement.** `CP` and `Θ` stand outside the quantifiers over `B`
and `p₀`, and hence outside the quantifier over the thickening parameter `θ` that
`ThickPlankPresentation.nonconcentration` carries: one constant per exponent, valid for every
ball, every body and every `θ`. That is obligation (d) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody` discharged at the level of the statement.

This is a *predicate* and not a theorem, and that too is the statement. `CP` and `Θ` may not be
universally quantified here, since they occur on the *large* side of the comparabilities and of
the non-concentration bound; they may not be produced existentially, since the parameter budget
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable` has to be asserted at the *same* `CP` and could not
see the witness; and they may not be pinned to a value, since the blueprint introduces them by
their defining property and any value chosen here would make this predicate false or — if the
value were sealed — independent. So they are carried as data, once, by the fields
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.CP` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData.Θ`, and this
predicate and the budget are two fields of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds` stated at that one pair. See the module docstring.

The bias constant of blueprint `lemmafactmaxbias` is not part of either: it is the explicit
factor `bd.Cbias` in the fields `frostman` and `nonconcentration`.

**What is assumed, and why it is satisfiable.** Take `CP = C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(bd.C₀)` and
`Θ = C_{lem:ml2thickMbound}(bd.C₀)`, the constants of blueprint `def:ml2thickPlankConstant` and
`def:ml2thickMboundConstant`; at those values the predicate is exactly what blueprint
`lem:ml2thickPlank`, `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol` and `lem:ml2thickMbound` assert. Three distinct
pieces of that are not formalized, and none is thick-case material:

* the alignment estimate behind blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank`(i) — that a convex body of
  diameter `∼ r₁` contained in a body of thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` is nearly parallel to the
  long frame direction, so that the anisotropic `L` acts on its frame essentially diagonally.
  The blueprint asserts it with the constant `C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}(C₀)` and does not prove
  it; it belongs in the convex-body chapter next to blueprint `def:outerPrism`;
* the replacement of the images `L(T_B)`, which are convex bodies comparable to planks, by
  genuine `Plank`s. This is obligation (b): it costs constants of the same kind as those
  already carried by `CP` and `Θ`, so it changes no exponent, but it is not carried out;
* for a general anisotropic `L`, the invariance of `maxDensity` and of
  `IsEssentiallyDistinct`. `Kakeya.volume_affineImage` and the transport suite of
  `Kakeya/AffineMap.lean` — built on `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_image_linearMap` — already
  give the volume identity, the fullness and the multiplicity for an arbitrary affine
  equivalence, so this residue is narrower than obligation (c) of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody` records, but `Kakeya/Homothety.lean` still carries
  `maxDensity_homothety` and `IsEssentiallyDistinct.image_homothety` for homotheties only,
  and `L` normalising the outer prism of `W` is anisotropic.

The non-concentration field additionally rests on blueprint `lem:ml2thickThickenedVol`, the
pullback volume bound `|K_θ|/|W| ≤ 2³ C_{lem:ml2thickPlank}^4 |B₁|^{-1} θ (δ/a)²`, and on the
biased comparison `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.biasedDensity` of (C4) applied at
`K = L^{-1}((P)_θ) ∩ W`; the first is unformalized, the second is available. -/

This is the conclusion of blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlankF` at `ε = ν` and prescribed constant
`1`, read through blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank`(ii) and cleared of division, so that no

/-- **The parameter budget of blueprint `plankF`, at the scales of the configuration.**

Blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlankF` applies `plankF` at `ε = ν = ϱβτ/8`, and needs the parameters
`η_{plankF}` and `b₀` that `plankF` produces to be compatible with the configuration: `δ/a` must
be below `b₀`, and `cfg.η` must be below `τ η_{plankF}`. This predicate says exactly that, with
the comparison constant `CP` of blueprint `lem:ml2thickPlank` made explicit, because the plank
family lives at `a' ≤ CP δ/b` and `b' ≤ CP δ/a` rather than at `δ/b` and `δ/a` on the nose.

The second threshold carries one extra factor `CP`, i.e. it reads
`CP (CP δ/b)^{η_{plankF}} ≤ c₁ δ^{2η}`. That factor pays for the enclosure: the planks of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation` *contain* the images `L(T_p)`, so their fullness
is smaller than the block's by at most `CP` and not equal to it. See
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPres_fullness_ge`. It is the same kind of smallness condition on
`δ` as before, `CP` being fixed ahead of `δ`.

The estimate and the threshold on `b₀` are bundled deliberately.
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` is antitone in both `η_{plankF}` and `b₀` — the
smaller they are, the weaker the statement — while both thresholds ask for them to be *large*.
So neither parameter can be quantified away from the thresholds, and the honest hypothesis is
that `plankF` holds *at parameters that fit `cfg`*, rather than that it holds and, separately,
that some thresholds are met.

**The exponent `ηF` is a parameter of this predicate, not an existential inside it**, for the
same reason `CP` is: it has to be compared with `cfg.η` from outside. Under the thick-case
guard `δ^{1-τ} ≤ a` the second threshold reads `CP^{1+ηF} δ^{τ ηF - 2η} ≤ c₁` (F8: (C5) at
`δ^{2η}`), so it is met for `δ` small exactly when `2η < τ ηF` —
which is the field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.budget` since R16-A — and that comparison is a relation between `δ`-free
parameters. With `ηF` bound inside the predicate the relation could not be stated at all, and
nothing would prevent the witness from exceeding the exponent at which the estimate is still
true; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent`. The relation itself is the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.budget`, and it is arranged, at the canonical
exponent, by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams`.

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` carry no field for either
threshold, and blueprint `hyp:ml2params` lists no such budget; this is obligation (d) of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody`, now named rather than absorbed. -/

  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.one_le_thickM` — where `hPcard`, blueprint `lem:ml2thickPcard`, is
  used — and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickM_ne_top`. Note that `M` carries the *block*
  cardinality while `plankF` is applied to the *selected* family, so its conclusion carries
  `|sel|`; the two are compared by `sel_card`, in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.denseInBodyRaw_of_thickPlankPresentation`.

The conclusion is the display of blueprint `plankF` at `ε = ν = ϱβτ/8`, in the shape that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickPlankF_product_lower` bounds from below. -/
