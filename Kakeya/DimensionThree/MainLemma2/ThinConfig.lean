# The configurations of Main Lemma 2, relative to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky`

The Lean structure `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` records only the *global* data of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup`, i.e. (C1) together with the biased factoring and the distinguished pair of
working scales `a ≤ b`. It carries none of the per-ball data (C2)–(C5): the covering family
`𝔅`, the subordinate partition `(B̂)`, the tube segments `𝕋_B` with their shading `Y_B` and
parent families `𝕋(T_B)`, or the per-ball factorings `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}`.

Every branch lemma of the thin case speaks about that per-ball data, and about the thin-case
refinement `hyp:ml2thinsetup` built on top of it. Passing those pieces as free arguments makes
the branch lemmas unsound as case-split components: nothing then ties the family of factoring
bodies to `cfg`, so instantiating it by `∅` satisfies the multiplicity hypotheses vacuously.
This file fixes that by bundling the data *relative to a fixed `cfg`*, in two layers:

* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData` renders the per-ball part of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`,
  i.e. (C2)–(C5), for a fixed `cfg`. All the scales it mentions are read off `cfg`: the ball
  radius is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.r₁ cfg = δ^{exscal}`, the tube thickness is `cfg.δ`, the
  body dimensions are `cfg.a`, `cfg.b`, and the density exponent of (C5) is `2 · cfg.η`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig` renders Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` over a given
  `BallData`: the global refined shading `Y'` on `𝕋`, and for each ball `B ∈ 𝔅` a
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` — the per-ball payload (T1)–(T6), which is *not* duplicated here
  — with one and the same comparison constant `C` for every ball, together with the two
  compatibility containments of (T1) relating `Y'` to the per-ball `Y'_B`.
* `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` packages the fixed-scale thresholds needed by the
  non-slab leaves after the exponent parameters and `BallData` have been fixed, together with
  the by-choice thresholds bundled as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds`.

The split into two structures follows the blueprint: `hyp:ml2thinsetup` is stated as *extra
data attached to the same pair* `(𝕋, Y)` realizing `hyp:ml2setup`, not as an extra hypothesis
on it, so the two layers are separate objects and the second one is parameterized by the
first. The fields of `ThinConfig` are exactly the data and the conclusion of
`Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupExists`, and the fields of `BallData` are exactly its (C2)–(C5)
hypotheses; `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_thinConfig` is the `cfg`-relative form of blueprint
`lem:ml2thinsetupexists` and is intended to be deduced from `thinSetupExists`.

/-- **The per-ball data of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, relative to `cfg`** (blueprint
`hyp:ml2setup`, items (C2)–(C5)).

`cfg : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` already carries (C1) and the global factoring data of (C4) —
the working scales `a ≤ b` and the distinguished part `W` — but none of the per-ball
structure. `BallData cfg` supplies it, with every scale tied to `cfg`:

* (C2) the index type `bι` of the non-empty family `𝔅` of `r₁`-balls, with `r₁ = cfg.r₁`,
  their centres `ctr`, the subordinate partition `P B = B̂ ⊆ B` and the bounded-overlap
  bound `D`; the pieces are pairwise disjoint, measurable, and cover every `Y_g(T)`.
* (C3) the tube segments `segs B = 𝕋_B` with shading `Y = Y_B` supported in `B̂`, the parent
  families `fam p = 𝕋(T_B) ⊆ 𝕋`, pairwise disjoint, and the affine thicknesses
  `∼ (r₁, δ, δ)` of the segments.
* (C4) the bodies `bodies B = 𝕎_B` with `Wb` the body and `blk` the block map, of affine
  thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` with the *same* constant `C₀` for every ball, contained in the
  ball `B` and pairwise essentially distinct (being blocks of a factoring), together with
  the common shortest dimension `w₁ ≈ τ₂(W)` and the Frostman constant `CF` of each block
  in its body, and the biased density comparison `biasedDensity` of blueprint equation
  `factmaxmodbias` with its constant `Cbias`, which is what the factoring at bias `cfg.ϱ`
  yields inside each body.
* (C5) the per-segment density bound with constant `c₁`, the two-way compatibility of
  `Y_B` with `Y_g`, and the fibre count `|𝕋(T_B)_{Y_g}(x)| ≈ m` on `Y_B(T_B)` with comparison
  constant `Cm`.
* (C5′) the *working shading* `Yg = Y_g ⊆ Y` on which (C5) and the covering half of (C2) are
  read: GWZ's `Y` after the per-tube refinements of §9.3 steps
  6–8, which they carry "by abuse of notation" (GWZ); it is a `⪆ 1`
  refinement of the uniform shading of `cfg`, with loss `Cg` (`Yg_mass`). The text of this
  block is pinned by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.statement_of_universal_ballData_workingShading`.

The last group of fields is the family of `δ`-ball covers `𝒞(T_B)` of Configuration
`hyp:ml2thinsetup`, which the blueprint fixes before the thin-case construction begins; it is
carried here because it is an input to `Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupExists`, not an output.

The bounded overlap of the balls of `𝔅` is stated in the subfamily form
`ballOverlap`: any subfamily of `𝔅` all of whose balls contain a common point has at most
`D` members. This is equivalent to the `Finset.filter` form of
`Kakeya.IsBoundedlyOverlappingCover.card_filter_le` and avoids a decidability instance in
the statement. The covering half of (C2) is `P_cover`, stated for the working shading `Y_g`,
which is the form (C2) singles out as not following from the covering of `U(𝕋_{r₁}, Y)`. -/
structure BallData (cfg : VeryNotSticky.{u}) where
  /-- The thickness comparison constant of (C3) and (C4). -/
  C₀ : ℝ≥0

  CF : ℝ≥0
  /-- `1 ≤ CF`. -/
  hCF : 1 ≤ CF
  /-- The comparison constant of the dilation clause `segs_dilation` of (C3). It is a free field, like `C₀` and `CF`: `BallData` bounds it from above
  nowhere, and it is spent exactly once, in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.final`, where the
  `δ`-free constants of the slab case are absorbed against `δ^{β/2}`. The coarse producers
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonempty_ballData_deleteShade`) supply `Cdil = 1`; the honest capsules
  of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_segments` need a dimensional constant. -/
  Cdil : ℝ≥0
  /-- `1 ≤ Cdil`. -/
  hCdil : 1 ≤ Cdil
  /-- **Constant in Lemma `lemmafactmaxbias`** (blueprint `def:factmaxbiasConstant`,
  `C_{lemmafactmaxbias}`): the comparison constant of the per-ball biased density comparison
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.biasedDensity` of (C4), i.e. of blueprint equation
  `factmaxmodbias`. It is the constant `C` common to the two displayed estimates of the maximal
  density factoring lemma for the factoring it produces at bias `cfg.ϱ`: `factmaxmod1`, the
  biased density comparison that `biasedDensity` records, and `factmaxmod2` = GWZ (83), the
  anti-clustering `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ≤ C (|W|/|B|)^{-ϱ}` at `U = B`, which `bodies_antiClustering`
  records as `Cbias δ^{-2ϱ}` after the volume estimate `|W|/|B| ≳ δ²`. `C` depends only on the ambient dimension
  and the bias exponent (blueprint `def:factmaxbiasConstant`, Lean
  `ConvexSpaceBody.nonempty_biasedFactorization.C`) — not on `cfg.δ`, not on the cardinality of
  the family, and on nothing attached to a single ball: one and the same value serves every
  `B ∈ 𝔅`, every body `W ∈ 𝕎_B` and every comparison body `K ⊆ W`. It is kept separate from
  the thickness constant `C₀`, which measures a different quantity. -/
  Cbias : ℝ≥0
  /-- `1 ≤ Cbias`. -/
  hCbias : 1 ≤ Cbias
  /-- The per-segment density constant of (C5). -/
  c₁ : ℝ≥0
  /-- `0 < c₁`. Without it the density bound `segs_density` is vacuous, the shading `Y` may be
  everywhere empty, and the `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` demanded by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig` — whose fields `S_nonempty` and `denseBall` together force
  a `δ`-ball of positive shaded measure — cannot exist. -/
  hc₁ : 0 < c₁
  /-- The bounded-overlap constant of the ball cover of (C2) and of the `δ`-ball covers. -/
  D : ℕ
  /-- (C5′) the *working shading* `Y_g ⊆ Y` of GWZ §9.3: `Y` after the per-tube refinements of
  steps 6–8 (GWZ: "abusing notation, we will continue to refer to this as
  `(𝕋, Y)`"), kept apart from the uniform shading of `cfg`, which is Lemma 9.1's hypothesis and is never re-established after those steps. The coarse producers take
  `Yg := (cfg.T i).shade`, `Cg := 1`. -/
  Yg : cfg.ι → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))
  /-- (C5′) `Y_g(T) ⊆ Y(T)`. -/
  Yg_subset : ∀ i ∈ cfg.s, Yg i ⊆ (cfg.T i).shade
  /-- (C5′) `Y_g` is measurable. -/
  Yg_measurable : ∀ i ∈ cfg.s, MeasurableSet (Yg i)
  /-- (C5′) the loss of the working shading against `Y`; polylogarithmic (heavy balls, Markov
  tier, Lemma 9.2's subset, the dims class), never a power of `δ`. -/
  Cg : ℝ≥0
  /-- `1 ≤ Cg`. -/
  hCg : 1 ≤ Cg
  /-- (C5′) `(𝕋, Y_g)` is a `⪆ 1` refinement of `(𝕋, Y)` (GWZ). -/
  Yg_mass : (Cg : ℝ≥0∞)⁻¹ * ∑ i ∈ cfg.s, volume (cfg.T i).shade ≤
    ∑ i ∈ cfg.s, volume (Yg i)
  /-- The index type of the family `𝔅` of `r₁`-balls of (C2). -/
  bι : Type u
  /-- The index type of the tube segments `𝕋_B` of (C3). -/
  σ : Type u
  /-- The index type of the factoring bodies `𝕎_B` of (C4). -/
  ω : Type u
  /-- Decidable equality on the body index type, needed to form the blocks `𝕋_{B,W}`. -/
  [decidableEqω : DecidableEq ω]
  /-- (C2) the non-empty family `𝔅` of `r₁`-balls. -/
  bs : Finset bι
  /-- (C2) `𝔅` is non-empty. -/
  bs_nonempty : bs.Nonempty
  /-- (C2) the centre of the ball `B`. -/
  ctr : bι → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)
  /-- (C2) the piece `B̂` of the partition subordinate to `𝔅`. -/
  P : bι → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))
  /-- (C2) `B̂ ⊆ B`, the ball of radius `r₁ = δ^{exscal}` centred at `ctr B`. -/
  P_subset_ball : ∀ B ∈ bs, P B ⊆ closedBall (ctr B) (cfg.r₁ : ℝ)
  /-- (C2) the pieces `B̂` are pairwise disjoint. -/
  P_disjoint : (bs : Set bι).PairwiseDisjoint P
  /-- (C2) the pieces `B̂` are measurable. -/
  P_measurable : ∀ B ∈ bs, MeasurableSet (P B)
  /-- (C2) the pieces cover the *working* shading: `Y_g(T) ⊆ ⋃_{B ∈ 𝔅} B̂` for every `T ∈ 𝕋`.
  Read on `Y_g` rather than on `Y`: `bs` is GWZ's `𝔅`, the heavy
  balls of the winning class, and the shading outside their pieces has been deleted from
  `Y_g` (GWZ); the uniform shading `Y` need not be covered. -/
  P_cover : ∀ i ∈ cfg.s, Yg i ⊆ ⋃ B ∈ bs, P B
  /-- (C2) the balls of `𝔅` are `D`-boundedly overlapping: no point lies in more than `D`
  of them. -/
  ballOverlap : ∀ (x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) (t : Finset bι), t ⊆ bs →
    (∀ B ∈ t, x ∈ ball (ctr B) (cfg.r₁ : ℝ)) → t.card ≤ D
  /-- (C3) the family `𝕋_B` of tube segments in the ball `B`. -/
  segs : bι → Finset σ
  /-- (C3) the shading `Y_B` on the tube segments. -/
  Y : σ → ShadedBody (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))
  /-- (C3) the family `𝕋(T_B) ⊆ 𝕋` of parent tubes of a segment. -/
  fam : σ → Finset cfg.ι
  /-- (C5) each `𝕋_B` is non-empty. -/
  segs_nonempty : ∀ B ∈ bs, (segs B).Nonempty
  /-- (C3) the parent families are subfamilies of `𝕋`. -/
  fam_subset : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, fam p ⊆ cfg.s
  /-- (C3) the parent families are pairwise disjoint, so a tube has a unique parent
  segment in each ball. -/
  fam_disjoint : ∀ B ∈ bs, (segs B : Set σ).Pairwise fun p q => Disjoint (fam p) (fam q)
  /-- (C3) the shading `Y_B` is supported in the piece `B̂`. -/
  Y_piece : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, (Y p).shade ⊆ P B
  /-- (C3) the segments have affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, δ, δ)`. -/
  segs_thickness : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B,
    HasThicknesses (Y p).carrier C₀ ![(cfg.r₁ : ℝ), (cfg.δ : ℝ), (cfg.δ : ℝ)]
  /-- (C3) the segments of a ball have *comparable* affine thicknesses, in the exact form
  `ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCombined` demands. It is not a consequence of
  `segs_thickness`, which only compares the thicknesses up to the constant `C₀ ^ 2`. -/
  segs_dims : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, ∀ q ∈ segs B,
    Metric.thickness ℝ (Y p).carrier ≤ 2 • Metric.thickness ℝ (Y q).carrier
  /-- (C3) the segment families are comparable to `𝕋` in maximal density, up to the
  comparison constant `Cdil`: `r₁² Δ_max(𝕋_B) ≤ Cdil · Δ_max(𝕋)` for every `B ∈ 𝔅`, the
  division-free form of `Δ_max(𝕋_B) ≤ Cdil · r₁^{-2} Δ_max(𝕋)`, so that no positivity or
  finiteness side condition is needed in `[0, ∞]`.

  The content is a dilation comparison between the two families this item creates. A segment
  `T_B ⊆ K` is `T ∩ B` for a parent tube `T`, unique by `fam_disjoint`, and has length `∼ r₁`
  along the axis of `T` while `T` has length `1`; so `T` lies in the `r₁^{-1}`-dilate of `K`,
  of volume `r₁^{-3}|K|`, and `|T_B| ∼ r₁|T|` recovers one power of `r₁`. GWZ (GWZ) write the comparison at constant `1` for the exact intersections `T ∩ B`, under
  the convention of their §2.2 that comparisons of convex sets hold up to
  constants; the segments of this development are only `C₀`-comparable capsules
  (`segs_thickness`), for which the honest dilation bound carries a dimensional constant
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.segs_dilation_of_maxDensity_le` and its docstring). The constant is
  therefore made explicit as the field `Cdil` instead of being
  asserted away: the previous constant-`1` form was the over-strong rendering of a `⪅`.

  It is recorded as data rather than derived because both inputs of that computation are
  comparisons only in the development, and the companion of the maximal-density homothety
  comparison for a family of segments in terms of the family of their parents is not
  available. The sole consumer is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDensity`, which now carries
  `Cdil`; the constant is discharged, together with the other `δ`-free constants of the slab
  case, in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.final`. -/
  segs_dilation : ∀ B ∈ bs,
    (cfg.r₁ : ℝ≥0∞) ^ 2 * maxDensity (segs B) (fun p ↦ (Y p).toConvexSpaceBody) ≤
      (Cdil : ℝ≥0∞) * maxDensity cfg.s (fun i ↦ (cfg.T i).toConvexSpaceBody)
  /-- (C4) the family `𝕎_B` of factoring bodies in the ball `B`. -/
  bodies : bι → Finset ω
  /-- (C4) the body `W` attached to an index. -/
  Wb : ω → ConvexSpaceBody (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))
  /-- (C4) the block map of the factoring `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}`. -/
  blk : σ → ω
  /-- (C4) the common shortest dimension `w₁ ≈ τ₂(W)` of the bodies. -/
  w₁ : ℝ≥0
  /-- (C4) each segment belongs to a block of the ball it lies in. -/
  blk_mem : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, blk p ∈ bodies B
  /-- (C4) each segment is contained in the body of its block. -/
  segs_le : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, (Y p).toConvexSpaceBody ≤ Wb (blk p)
  /-- (C4) the bodies have affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)`, with the working scales `a`,
  `b` of `cfg`, and with one constant `C₀` for all balls. -/
  bodies_thickness : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ j ∈ bodies B,
    HasThicknesses (Wb j).carrier C₀ ![(cfg.r₁ : ℝ), (cfg.b : ℝ), (cfg.a : ℝ)]
  /-- (C4) the bodies of `𝕎_B` lie in the ball `B`. -/
  bodies_subset_ball : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ j ∈ bodies B,
    (Wb j).carrier ⊆ closedBall (ctr B) (cfg.r₁ : ℝ)
  /-- (C4) the shortest dimension of every body is comparable to the common value `w₁`. -/
  bodies_w₁ : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ j ∈ bodies B,
    Metric.thickness ℝ (Wb j).carrier (Module.finrank ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) - 1) ≤

      (w₁ : ℝ) ≤ 2 * Metric.thickness ℝ (Wb j).carrier
        (Module.finrank ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) - 1)
  /-- (C4) each block is `CF`-Frostman in its body. -/
  frostman : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ j ∈ bodies B,
    ConvexSpaceBody.IsFrostmanIn ((segs B).filter fun p => blk p = j)
      (fun p => (Y p).toConvexSpaceBody) (Wb j) CF
  /-- (C4) the *biased* density comparison inside a factoring body (blueprint equation
  `factmaxmodbias`): for every ball `B ∈ 𝔅`, every body `W ∈ 𝕎_B` and every convex body
  `K ≤ W`,
  `Δ(𝕋_{B,W}, K) ≤ C_{lemmafactmaxbias} (|K|/|W|)^ϱ Δ(𝕋_{B,W}, W)`,
  which is the blueprint's `Δ(𝕋_{B,W}, W)/Δ(𝕋_{B,W}, K) ⪆ (|W|/|K|)^ϱ` cleared of division.

  This is the per-ball instance of `factmaxmod1`, i.e. of the field
  `ConvexSpaceBody.BiasedFactorization.densityIn_le_biased`, for the factoring
  `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}` of (C4). The configuration carries no global factoring of `𝕋`; it is the output of the maximal density factoring lemma
  applied per ball with bias `cfg.ϱ`, and therefore data of (C4) rather than a hypothesis of
  any single case.

  The product form is deliberate: it is division-free, so no positivity or finiteness side
  condition is needed, and its right-hand side is a monotone product, so `gcongr` can rewrite
  under it. -/
  biasedDensity : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ j ∈ bodies B,
    ∀ K : ConvexSpaceBody (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)), K ≤ Wb j →
      densityIn ((segs B).filter fun p => blk p = j) (fun p => (Y p).toConvexSpaceBody) K ≤

          densityIn ((segs B).filter fun p => blk p = j)
            (fun p => (Y p).toConvexSpaceBody) (Wb j)
  /-- (C4) the outer family of the per-ball factoring is anti-clustered:
  `Δ_max(𝕎_B) ≤ C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}` for every `B ∈ 𝔅`, with the same constant `Cbias` as
  `biasedDensity`.

  This is the second displayed estimate of the maximal density factoring lemma, applied to the
  per-ball factoring of this item with reference body `U = B`, followed by the volume estimate
  `|W|/|B| ∼ ab/r₁² ≥ δ^{2-2 exscal} ≥ δ²` that the thicknesses of this item supply; the two
  comparison constants are absorbed into `Cbias`, which is why no constant of its own appears.
  Like `biasedDensity` it is per-ball data of (C4): the configuration carries no global
  factoring of `𝕋`, so nothing above the ball supplies it.

  The exponent is deliberately the honest `2ϱ` rather than the weakened `exscal`: the
  conversion `2ϱ ≤ exscal` costs the budget `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slabBias`
  together with a threshold on `δ`, and both are spent later, in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale`, where the constants can be discharged at the same time.
  The bound passes to subfamilies, since each competing convex body sees a smaller sum; this is
  how `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodiesAntiClustering` applies it to the retained family
  `𝕎'_B`. -/
  bodies_antiClustering : ∀ B ∈ bs,
    maxDensity (bodies B) Wb ≤ (Cbias : ℝ≥0∞) * (cfg.δ : ℝ≥0∞) ^ (-(2 * cfg.ϱ))
  /-- (C5) the per-segment density bound `|Y_B(T_B)| ≥ c₁ δ^{2η} |T_B|` — GWZ
   `λ(𝕋_B, Y_B) ⪆ δ^η`, rendered as the tree renders every `⪆ δ^η` on this path
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fullness_ge`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.lam_ge`, T1's floor): `δ^{2η}`
  with a `δ`-free constant `c₁` (pinned by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.statement_of_universal_ballData_C5_density`). -/
  segs_density : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B,
    (c₁ : ℝ≥0∞) * (cfg.δ : ℝ≥0∞) ^ (2 * cfg.η) * volume (Y p).carrier ≤
      volume (Y p).shade
  /-- (C5) a tube whose working shading `Y_g(T)` meets `B̂` has a parent segment in `B`
  ( `segs B` is GWZ's post-step-6 `𝕋_B`, the light segments being
  simply absent, their `Y_g(T) ∩ B̂` deleted). -/
  parent : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ i ∈ cfg.s, (Yg i ∩ P B).Nonempty → ∃ p ∈ segs B, i ∈ fam p
  /-- (C5) `Y_g(T) ∩ B̂ ⊆ Y_B(T_B)` for a parent segment `T_B` of `T` in `B`. -/
  into : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, ∀ i ∈ fam p, Yg i ∩ P B ⊆ (Y p).shade
  /-- (C5) conversely `Y_B(T_B) ⊆ ⋃_{T ∈ 𝕋(T_B)} Y_g(T)`. -/
  back : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, (Y p).shade ⊆ ⋃ i ∈ fam p, Yg i
  /-- (C3) the *directional* half of the comparability `T ∩ B̂ ∼ T_B`: a segment `T_B` lies in
  the `C₀δ`-neighbourhood of the core line of each of its parent tubes `T ∈ 𝕋(T_B)`.

  The remaining fields record the comparability only through volumes and thicknesses:
  `segs_thickness` says `T_B` is a `C₀`-comparable `r₁ × δ × δ` body, `into`/`back` relate the
  shadings, and `segs_dilation` compares densities. None of them constrains the *direction* of
  `T_B` relative to `T`, and without such a constraint the axis of the factoring body
  `W = W(T_B)` is unrelated to the directions of the tubes of `𝕋(T_B)`.

  This field is what makes blueprint `lem:ml2bodyAngle` usable at the configuration level: it is
  exactly the hypothesis `hST` of `Kakeya.NonSlab.lineAngle_bodyAxis_le`, whose conclusion
  `∠(T, v(W)) ≤ C_{lem:ml2bodyAngle}(C₀) · b/r₁` is the angle bound
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.segAngle` feeds to the compatible refinement
  `Kakeya.NonSlab.compat`. The base point of the line is existentially quantified because
  `lineAngle_bodyAxis_le` uses only the *direction* of the line.

  Like every other field here it is supplied by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData`,
  which constructs the only `BallData` in the development. -/
  segs_core : ∀ B ∈ bs, ∀ p ∈ segs B, ∀ i ∈ fam p,

        (AffineSubspace.mk' q (Submodule.span ℝ {(cfg.T i).direction}) :
          Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)))
  /-- (C5) the common fibre-count scale: `|𝕋(T_B)_Y(x)| ≈ m` on `Y_B(T_B)`, with one and the
  same `m` for every ball and every segment. -/
  m : ℝ≥0
  /-- (C5) the comparison constant of the fibre count. -/
  Cm : ℝ≥0
  /-- `1 ≤ Cm`. -/
  hCm : 1 ≤ Cm
  /-- (C5) the fibre count `|𝕋(T_B)_{Y_g}(x)| ≈ m` for `x ∈ Y_B(T_B)`, read on the working
  shading `Y_g`. This is what `Kakeya.ThinCase.liftFibre` and
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.lift` consume, and hence what makes the refinement conclusion of
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupExists` true: without it a segment outside `𝒮_B` with an

/-! ### The working-shading block (C5′) and the (C5) clauses on it, pinned

The `statement_of_universal_*` device (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.statement_of_universal_thinConfig_T7`):
the licensed text of the fields is a named `Prop`, and a theorem checks that the fields *are*
that proposition, by projection. A later change to any of the nine clauses — `Y_g` identified
to `Y`, the mass clause dropped, a (C5) clause read on a different shading — fails to elaborate
here. -/


/-- **The ascending frame of a convex body of `ℝ³`, at the ambient dimension**:
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyFrame` with the proof `finrank_euclideanSpace_fin` of
`dim ℝ³ = 3` supplied once.

Folded for the reason recorded on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyNormal`: written out, the `finrank`
proof and the five instance searches around it are re-elaborated at every occurrence, and two
occurrences in one statement already exhaust a declaration's heartbeat budget. Use
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyFrame_zero` rather than `simp`/`unfold`.

It lives here, upstream of both `Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankPresentation` (which
hands it to the prescribed-frame enclosure) and
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.TypicalAngle` (which reads angles off it), because those two
files are siblings and each needs the *same* folded constant; two copies would be two distinct
declarations of the same name. -/

/-- **Fixed-scale thresholds for Main Lemma 2**.

All the conditions hold eventually as `δ → 0+` after the exponent parameters, the comparison
constants `bd.C₀` and `C`, and the thresholds `thr` have been fixed. Packaging them prevents
the fixed-scale case lemmas from silently absorbing constants or assuming that the dilated
scale `ρ₂*` is at most one.

The structure is indexed by:

* both threshold exponents `τ` and `τ'` of blueprint `hyp:ml2params`: the third condition is
  conditional on the thin-case hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`, and the fifth is the transverse
  transfer-radius threshold, which is a condition on `τ'`;
* the gain `ν`, at which blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData` is invoked, since the threshold of
  `aScaleData_threshold` depends on it. That gain is a function of `β` and `ζ` alone, so
  unlike `C` it is fixed before `δ`, and the case split arranges the configuration at each of
  its two values at no cost. Along the non-slab chain the index is read at the transverse gain
  `τ'β/2`, that being the gain at which
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge` invokes
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`; the thick gain `ϱβτ/8` reaches
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge_of_goalDensity` as a bare binder instead, that
  statement seeing neither `bd` nor a thin-case constant;
* the constant `C`, which the call site instantiates at `tc.C` for the ambient
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig`. It is produced by blueprint `lem:ml2thinsetupexists`, i.e.
  *after* `δ`, which is why `transverse_ballFill` is written as a comparison of terms rather
  than as a `δ ≤ δ_*` (the latter would be circular) and why arranging that clause is an
  obligation of blueprint `lem:ml2casesplit`, at the point where `C` is produced, rather than
  of any statement of the transverse chain;
* the by-choice thresholds `thr`, for the reason given on
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds`.

Apart from `C` and `thr`, every condition is an inequality between quantities determined by
`cfg`, `bd` and the exponents, so none of them mentions a constant produced later in the
development; that is what keeps the bundle satisfiable, and the two extra indices are exactly
what restores that invariant for the clauses that would otherwise break it.

All *thirteen* clauses of blueprint `hyp:ml2scale` are fields here. The tenth,
`plankCardBiasThreshold`, mentions `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankEnclosureConstant`, and the
twelfth, `typicalAngleSelectionThreshold`, mentions
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSelectionConstant`; both constants are declared in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.PlankConstants`, upstream of this file, for exactly that
reason. Neither needs an index of its own, `Cbias` being a field of `bd`. -/

  /-- In the transverse branch, the transfer radius `ρ = θ b / 2 ≥ δ^{-τ'} a / 2` exceeds the
  covering radius `3A = 3 C_{w₁}(C₀) a` of blueprint `def:ml2thinW1Constant`. This is the
  fixed-scale threshold that blueprint `lem:ml2transverseMassBall` discharges with the phrase
  "once `δ` is small enough": since `τ' > 0` the left-hand side is a function of `bd.C₀`
  alone while `δ^{-τ'} → ∞` as `δ → 0+`. It is consumed by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`, which passes it to
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill` as the hypothesis `hsmall`. -/
  transverse_radius : 6 * ThinCase.w1Constant bd.C₀ ≤ cfg.δ ^ (-τ')
  /-- The sixth clause, blueprint `transverseFillThreshold`. It pays for the two explicit
  factors that the proof of blueprint `lem:ml2transverseFill` absorbs into its constant: the
  `3³` discarded with the dilation of the radius, and the `max(1, C₀/3)³` paid for enlarging
  the produced radius to `r ≥ θ b`. It is what lets that lemma conclude the sub-polynomial
  bound `transverseFillConstantBound`. It is stated at `η/2` rather than at `η` because the
  bound it serves is assembled from two halves, of which Section 6 supplies the other. -/
  transverse_fill : 27 * max 1 (bd.C₀ / 3) ^ 3 ≤ cfg.δ ^ (-(cfg.η / 2))
  /-- The seventh clause, blueprint `transverseBallFillThreshold`. It pays for the three
  explicit factors of blueprint `def:ml2transverseBallFillConstant` — the `2³`, the
  `c_{lem:massSubball}(3,2)⁻¹ = 5³` and the transfer constant
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.transferConstant C bd.C₀` — whose product carries the factor
  `2³ * 5³ = 1000`, and it is what lets blueprint `lem:ml2transverseBallFillConstantBound`
  conclude `transverseBallFillConstantBound`.

  This is the one clause whose left-hand side is not a function of `bd.C₀` and the exponent
  parameters alone, since `C` is produced after `δ`; the index `C` is what restores the module
  invariant. It is nevertheless arrangeable: `C` is sub-polynomial in `δ⁻¹` and
  `transferConstant` is an explicit polynomial in `C` and `bd.C₀`, so the whole left-hand side
  is sub-polynomial while the right-hand side is `δ^{-η}` with `η > 0` fixed. -/
  transverse_ballFill : 1000 * ThinCase.transferConstant C bd.C₀ ≤ cfg.δ ^ (-cfg.η)
  /-- The eighth clause, blueprint `aScaleDataThreshold`: `δ` lies below the by-choice
  threshold of blueprint `lem:ml2aScaleData` at the gain `ν`. This is what makes clause (iii)
  of that lemma provable rather than refutable — without it the assertion fails at `δ` near
  `1`, since it bounds by `δ^{-η}` a constant that is at least `1` and does not tend to `1` as
  `δ → 1`. It is the clause the transverse chain spends, in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`, to discharge the hypothesis `hthr` of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData`; that is why the gain `ν` indexing this structure
  is read at the transverse gain `τ'β/2` all the way down the non-slab chain. See the caveat
  on `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds`: while `thr` carries no defining property, this
  clause is trivially satisfiable and does not have that effect. -/
  aScaleData_threshold : cfg.δ ≤ thr.aScale ν
  /-- The ninth clause, blueprint `typicalAngleThreshold`: `δ` lies below the by-choice
  threshold of blueprint `lem:ml2typicalangle`. It does for `typicalAngleConstantBound` what
  the eighth clause does for clause (iii) of `lem:ml2aScaleData`. It may not mention `Cbias`,
  on pain of circularity, which is what the tenth clause `plankCard_bias` below buys. -/
  typicalAngle_threshold : cfg.δ ≤ thr.typical
  /-- The typical-angle *constant* threshold. `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`
  binds its comparison constant `C` before every geometric datum and carries no upper bound on it
  — with `C` bound after the configuration and pinched by `C ≤ δ^{-ε}` the statement is false, see
  its docstring — so the bound `C ≤ (δ')^{-η/1024}` that
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.typicalAngleArith` spends is a genuine smallness condition on `δ` and has
  to be assumed here. It is of the seventh clause's shape and legitimate for the seventh clause's
  reason: the left-hand side is `Kakeya.typicalAngleScaledConst` at arguments built from `bd.C₀`,
  `bd.Cbias` and the exponent parameters, while the right-hand side is `(δ')^{-η/1024}` with
  `η > 0` fixed, and `δ' = δ^{1 - exscal} → 0`. Like the tenth clause it mentions `Cbias`, which
  is why it is a clause of its own rather than part of `typicalAngle_threshold`. -/
  typicalAngle_const :
    Kakeya.typicalAngleScaledConst.{u} (cfg.η / 1024)
        (plankCardConstant * (plankEnclosureConstant bd.C₀ * bd.Cbias *

      (cfg.δ / cfg.r₁ : ℝ≥0) ^ (-(cfg.η / 1024))
  /-- The tenth clause, blueprint `plankCardBiasThreshold`:
  `C_{lem:ml2plankpresentation}(C₀) * C_bias * δ^ϱ ≤ 1`.

  It is of the seventh clause's shape and is there for the seventh clause's reason: the
  biased-factoring constant `bd.Cbias` of (C4) is, like the thin-case comparison constant
  `C`, produced *after* `δ`, and it enters the cardinality bridge that blueprint
  `lem:ml2typicalangle` feeds to `findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection` through the
  anti-clustering bound of (C4). Since the ninth clause is a `δ ≤ δ_*` for a threshold
  defined by choice, it may not mention `Cbias` on pain of circularity; this clause is what
  buys that, by paying for `Cbias` separately out of the surplus `δ^ϱ` with `ϱ > 0` fixed
  before `δ`. Being a comparison of terms and not a `δ ≤ δ_*`, it is arrangeable by the
  argument that serves blueprint `hyp:ml2slabscale` rather than the one that serves the first
  six clauses, `plankEnclosureConstant bd.C₀` being a function of `bd.C₀` alone and `Cbias`
  sub-polynomial by blueprint `lemmafactmaxbias`. -/
  plankCard_bias : plankEnclosureConstant bd.C₀ * bd.Cbias * cfg.δ ^ cfg.ϱ ≤ 1
  /-- The eleventh clause, blueprint `transverseFillPlankThreshold`: the plank-to-slab
  reduction is available at the rescaled scale `δ' = δ/r₁`, at the exponents `ε = η/256`,
  `ε' = η/2` and the cardinality data `(C_{lem:ml2plankcard}, N_{lem:ml2plankcard} + 6ϱ)` at
  which blueprint `lem:ml2transverseFill` invokes it. It is what lets that lemma apply
  `lemmaredplanktubeAtTypicalAngle` at all, that lemma being stated under a smallness
  threshold on the scale it is applied at, while the transverse case applies it at `δ/r₁`.

  It replaces the earlier reading `cfg.δ ≤ thr.fill`, which said nothing:
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds.fill` carries no defining property, and the threshold
  it stands for is produced *existentially* by
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle`, so it cannot be named in a structure
  declared upstream of that lemma's call site. Asserting the conclusion at the scale in
  question says exactly what the by-choice threshold was meant to say, and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isReductionFillAvailable` certifies that it holds below a
  threshold fixed before `δ` — so this clause is of the eighth clause's shape, a genuine
  fixed-scale condition, and is neither vacuous nor unsatisfiable.

  The cardinality exponent is `plankCardExponent + 6ϱ` and not `plankCardExponent`: the
  cardinality bridge `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankCard` produces the bound with the
  `δ`-dependent factor `C(C₀) C_bias δ^{-2ϱ}`, which the tenth clause `plankCard_bias`
  converts into `δ^{-3ϱ}` and hence, by `δ^{-3ϱ} = (δ')^{-3ϱ/(1-exscal)} ≤ (δ')^{-6ϱ}` with
  `exscal < 1/2`, into a power of the rescaled scale with the `δ`-free constant
  `plankCardConstant` the reduction demands. -/
  transverseFill_threshold : IsReductionFillAvailable bd.ω (16 * cfg.η) plankCardConstant
    (plankCardExponent + 6 * cfg.ϱ) (cfg.δ / cfg.r₁)
  /-- **(O5) In the transverse case, the plank family of a thin ball is `(a')^η`-full**.

  This is the fullness hypothesis `λ(𝒫, Y) ≥ a^η` of GWZ Lemma 6.13 (GWZ:
  "let `(𝒫, Y)` be a set of `a × b × 1` planks in the unit ball with `λ(𝒫, Y) ≥ a^η` and
  `μ(𝒫, Y) ≥ a^{-η}`"), read at the plank family `𝒫 = L_B(𝕎'_B)` of blueprint
  `lem:ml2plankpresentation` and at the selected subfamily `𝕊*`, where
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` consumes it.

  **It is a mathematical input and not a matter of plumbing.** The setup supplies fullness
  only through (95), `λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ⪆ δ^{2η}` ((T2) in this development,
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies`), and `a'` is not comparable to `δ`: by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hδa'` and `hupper` one has
  `δ^{1-exscal} ≤ a' ≤ C₀ δ^{1-τ-exscal}`, so `(a')^η ≥ δ^{(1-τ-exscal)η}`, which exceeds
  `δ^{2η}` by a positive power of `δ` — shrinking `δ` makes the gap worse, so no constant and
  no smallness hypothesis repairs it. GWZ never assert `(a')^η`-fullness of the setup: they
  apply Lemma 6.13 at an exponent for which its hypothesis follows from (95) (their `a^{3η}`
  at  is `O(η)` bookkeeping). At the exponent `cfg.η` this clause is therefore stronger
  than anything the source or the configuration supplies (see also
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hfull`); the re-budgeting of that exponent is a
  separate, later steps, and this clause is where
  the Lean development records the debt.

  **The transverse guard.** GWZ invoke Lemma 6.13 only in the transverse case
  `θ ≥ δ^{-τ'} a/b` (GWZ: "We define the transverse case to be the case that
  `θ ≥ δ^{-τ'} a/b`"), and since the typical angle satisfies `θ ≤ 1`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hθ1`) that case can occur only when
  `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ 1`. The clause is asserted under exactly that guard. It is vacuous when
  `δ^{-τ'} a/b > 1` — in particular at `a = b`, the regime in which
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.false_of_transverseFill_fullness` refutes the unguarded clause — and
  it says what GWZ use precisely where GWZ use it. The consumer
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hfullP` carries the guard in the form
  `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ θ`, and `le_trans htrans ta.hθ1` produces this one at the transverse leaf.

  **The thin guard.** The clause is a §9.5 object: GWZ opens the thin case with
  "Now we consider the thin case when `a ∈ [δ, δ^{1-τ}]`", and the plank presentation, the
  typical angle and the transverse/tangential split all live inside that subsection (§9.4 is
  `a ≥ δ^{1-τ}`). So `cfg.a ≤ cfg.δ^{1-τ}` is a source condition of the concept, not an added
  hypothesis, and it is written in the same shape the neighbouring field
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.plank_small` already uses. The unique consumer
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` carries it as its own explicit binder and
  spends it on `plank_small` two lines above, so the guard costs nothing there; for the
  producers it is a gift.

  **The pins.** The quantifiers range over an arbitrary shaded plank family, so the clause
  would be false without them. The two pins on `a'` and the pin on `b'` tie the plank
  dimensions to those of the factoring bodies at the scale `r₁`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hlower`, `hupper`, `hbupper`); the *upper* pin
  on `b'` is the one that blocks the refutation of
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/CaseScaleNonslabRefute.lean` — a lower pin alone does not,
  since `b' = 1` satisfies it. The two hypotheses on `t` and on `SP` say that `t` retains a
  `(C^{sel})⁻¹` fraction of the shaded mass — which is what
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hselRefine` supplies for the selection `𝕊*` —
  and that the shadings of `SP` are the transports of `Y_{𝕎'_B}` under the homothety `L_B`,
  which multiplies every volume by `r₁⁻³`
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hvol`). With all of them, the statement is
  exactly `(a')^η ≤ λ(𝒫, Y_𝒫)` in the transverse case and nothing more.

  It is stated over `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` rather than over
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig` because that structure is declared below this one; at the
  call site it is read at `tc.thinBall hB`, whose comparison constant is the index `C`. -/

  `C^{sel}(C₀) ≤ δ^{-exscal·η}`.

  This is the threshold that `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilyMult` consumes as its `hthr`,
  and it is what lets `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` run
  `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` on the *selected* subfamily `𝕊*` rather
  than on all of `𝕎'_B` — where the enclosing planks are not pairwise essentially distinct, so
  that lemma does not apply. It is a genuine smallness condition in `δ` and not slack: the
  left-hand side is fixed once `bd.C₀` is, hence before `δ`, and the right-hand side is a
  positive power of `δ`; and it is spent with nothing to spare, which is why its exponent is
  `exscal · η`.

  It is of the tenth clause's shape rather than of the eighth's — a comparison of terms, not a
  `δ ≤ δ_*` — and it is arrangeable for the same reason: `plankSelectionConstant bd.C₀` is a
  function of `bd.C₀` alone. -/

  /-- The thirteenth clause, blueprint `typicalAngleCapThreshold`: `2 ≤ (δ')^{-η/512}` at the
  rescaled scale `δ' = δ / r₁`.

  It buys the *bounded* multiplicative room in which the typicality constant
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.Ctyp` may absorb the cap of
  `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle`. That definition floors the plank angle at `a/b` and caps it at
  `1`, so the typicality hypothesis carries no information about a pair of planks whose angle
  bound `Ctyp θ` has already reached `1`; but the field
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle` asks for a bound on the *uncapped* angle
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle`, which is at most `π/2 > 1`. Enlarging `Ctyp` by the factor
  `2 ≥ π/2` closes that gap — both `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` and
  `ShadedBody.HasCConstantMultiplicity` only weaken as the constant grows — and this clause is
  what keeps the enlarged constant inside the budget
  `Ctyp ≤ (δ')^{-η/256}` of `TypicalAngleData.hCtyp`.

  It is strictly stronger than `multiplicity_large` (whence `2 ≤ (δ')^{-η}`), which is kept as
  a separate field because it is consumed separately, as
  `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`'s hypothesis `hμ2`. Like the fourth clause
  it holds for small `δ`, `δ' = δ^{1-exscal} → 0` and `η > 0` being fixed first. -/

/-- **Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, relative to `cfg` and to its per-ball data**
.

The per-ball payload (T1)–(T6) is *not* restated here: it is
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall`, and the point of this structure is that the single comparison
constant `C` and the scales `cfg.δ`, `cfg.a`, `2 · cfg.η`, `bd.C₀` are shared by *every* ball, as
the blueprint demands ("these hold for all `B ∈ 𝔅` simultaneously"). The two genuinely global
assertions of (T1) — that `Y'` is a `⪆ 1` refinement of `Y` on `𝕋`, and the two-way
compatibility of `Y'` with the per-ball shadings `Y'_B` — are the remaining fields.

Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` is extra data attached to the same pair `(𝕋, Y)`; `cfg` is
not modified and continues to realize Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`. Accordingly the thin-case
hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` is *not* a field: none of (T1)–(T6) uses it, and it enters the branch
lemmas as a separate hypothesis. -/

  `δ^{2η} ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |T| ≤ C · Cm · m · ∑_{B ∈ 𝔅} ∑_{T_B ∈ 𝕋_B^{𝕎'}} |T_B|`, the sum on the right
  being over the segments whose block was retained by the factoring, i.e. over
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.retainedSegments`.

  The restriction to the retained blocks `𝕎'_B` is what makes the inequality usable: a segment
  whose block was discarded lies in no body of `𝕎'_B` and cannot be counted on the other side
  of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabSegmentSumSplit`, so the corresponding statement for all of
  `𝕋_B` is strictly weaker and does not imply this one. The blocks `𝕎'_B` are produced by this
  configuration and not by (C3), which is why the field lives here.

  **The loss is explicit**. GWZ (GWZ) pass from the
  per-ball `|𝕎'_B||W| ⪆ r₁²|𝕋_B||T_B|` to `|U(𝕋,Y)| ⪆ … r₁²|𝕋||T|` by "summing over the
  `r₁`-balls", which needs `∑_B |𝕋_B||T_B| ⪆ |𝕋||T|`. That step needs (i) each tube to meet
  `⪆ r₁^{-1}` pieces `B̂`, which holds only up to the density —
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fullness_ge` at `δ^{2η}` — and (ii) the comparability classes `𝕋(T_B)` to have `⪅ 1` members, which GWZ do not establish: a bush of tubes through one
  segment has up to the fibre count `≈ m` of (C5) (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.fibre`,
  constant `Cm`) members, and the passage from `Y` to the refined shading `Y'` of (T1) costs the
  comparison constant `C` (`Y'_mass`, `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.shade_containment`). So the `⪆`
  at  hides `δ^{O(η)}` and the fibre scale, and the earlier constant-`1` form of this
  field was the over-strong rendering of a `⪆`. The exact cost is recorded here: `δ^{2η}` on
  the left and `C · Cm · m` on the right. Downstream, the `δ^{2η}` joins the exponent of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabMassBound` (`9η ↦ 11η`), `C` and `Cdil` are absorbed in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.final`, `Cm · m` in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.fibreMass` at the budget `δ^{-(η+2 exscal)}`, and the budget
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab` reads `12η + 12 exscal + 3τ < β/2`, inside GWZ's
  "`τ, η, ϵ_scal ≪ β`".

  It is *derived*, not assumed: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.segment_mass_of_compat` proves it from
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fullness_ge`, `P_cover`/`P_measurable`, `parent`/`into`,
  `fam_subset`/`fam_disjoint`, `fibre`, the refinement bound `Y'_mass`, the forward
  compatibility `compat_forward` and `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.shade_containment`, and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_thinConfig` populates the field with that theorem rather than
  carrying it as a hypothesis. The text is pinned by

(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.statement_of_universal_caseScale_O5`,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.statement_of_universal_vns_fields`): the licensed text of the field is a
named `Prop`, and a theorem checks that the field *is* that proposition. A later change to the
field in either direction — the exponent moved, a constant dropped or added, the retained-block
filter weakened — fails to elaborate here, which a plain tripwire on a consumer would not notice
when the change is made in lockstep. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.Y'` records the refined shading as a bare family of sets,
because that is the form (T1)'s compatibility clauses are stated in. The multiplicity API and
`Kakeya.NonSlab.multSplit` speak about `ShadedBody`s instead, so the shading has to be attached
to the carriers it refines, namely the tubes of `𝕋` themselves.

Outside `cfg.s` the shading is replaced by `∅`. That is forced, not cosmetic: `Y'_subset` and
`Y'_measurable` are assumed only on `cfg.s`, so there is nothing to attach off it, and every
statement about this family quantifies over `i ∈ cfg.s`. -/

/-- **The local shaded union sits inside the global one**: `U(𝕋_B, Y'_B) ⊆ U(𝕋, Y)`.

This is the `cfg`-relative reading of blueprint `lem:ml2thinLocalToGlobal`, whose abstract
form is `Kakeya.ThinCase.localToGlobal`. Its conclusion is carried by this bundle as the
field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.compat_backward` — a point shaded by the per-ball
`Y'_B` at a segment `T_B` is shaded by the global `Y'` at one of the parent tubes of `T_B` —
and composing it with `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.Y'_subset` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.Yg_subset`, which say that `Y'` refines the working shading
`Y_g`, which refines `Y`, gives the containment in the pair `(𝕋, Y)` that the goal currencies
speak about.

It lives here, next to the two fields it composes, rather than in the branch files that
consume it: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill` needs it to turn the local conclusion
of `Kakeya.ThinCase.transfer_thin` into a statement about `(𝕋, Y)`. -/

/-- **The clause (T7) is a theorem of the configuration**.

For the refined global shading `Y'` of (T1) — `Y'(T) ⊆ Y_g(T)` inside the working shading of
`bd`, measurable, with `C⁻¹ ∑_T |Y(T)| ≤ ∑_T |Y'(T)|` — and a per-ball
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` family `tb` at the
same constant `C`, compatible with `Y'` in the forward direction
`Y'(T) ∩ T_B ∩ B̂ ⊆ Y'_B(T_B)` for `T ∈ 𝕋(T_B)`, the retained segments account for the tubes:
`δ^{2η} ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋} |T| ≤ C · Cm · m · ∑_{B ∈ 𝔅} ∑_{T_B ∈ 𝕋_B, W(T_B) ∈ 𝕎'_B} |T_B|`.

The three factors are the three losses hidden in GWZ's "summing over the `r₁`-balls"
(GWZ), each paid exactly once:
* `δ^{2η}` is the aggregate density `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fullness_ge`, through
  `ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul`: `δ^{2η} ∑|T| ≤ ∑|Y(T)|`;
* `C` is the refinement loss `Y'_mass` cleared of its inverse (`C ≥ 1` by
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.one_le_C` at any ball, `𝔅` being non-empty): `∑|Y(T)| ≤ C ∑|Y'(T)|`;
* `Cm · m` is the fibre count `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.fibre`: at a point `x ∈ Y_B(T_B)`
  at most `Cm · m` tubes of `𝕋(T_B)` are shaded, so
  `∑_{T ∈ 𝕋(T_B)} |Y'(T) ∩ B̂| ≤ Cm · m · |Y_B(T_B)| ≤ Cm · m · |T_B|`
  (`MeasureTheory.sum_measure_le_mul_measure_of_card_le`).

Between them the bookkeeping is exact. `P_cover` (on `Y_g ⊇ Y'`) splits `Y'(T)` over the
pieces, `|Y'(T)| ≤ ∑_B |Y'(T) ∩ B̂|`. At a ball `B`, a tube `T` with `|Y'(T) ∩ B̂| > 0` has a
parent segment `T_B` (`parent`, its working shading meeting `B̂`); its shading in `B̂` lies in
`Y_B(T_B)` (`into`), hence — by the forward
compatibility — in `Y'_B(T_B)`, so `W(T_B) ∈ 𝕎'_B` by `shade_containment`: the parent is
*retained*. `fam_disjoint` makes the parent unique, whence
`∑_T |Y'(T) ∩ B̂| ≤ ∑_{T_B retained} ∑_{T ∈ 𝕋(T_B)} |Y'(T) ∩ B̂|`. Nothing beyond the fields of
`cfg`, of `bd` and of the `ThinBall`s is used; `P_disjoint` and `compat_backward` are not
needed. -/

/-! ### Positivity at a thin ball

Blueprint `lem:ml2thinBallPositivity`. Every quotient taken at a ball of the thin case —
the fullness `λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`, the multiplicity `μ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` and their
counterparts at a refinement — needs its denominator to be positive, and the lemmas below
are where that comes from. They are stated here, with Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` and
Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, rather than in the tangential file, because they are about
the configuration alone.
-/

/-- **Every factoring body has positive volume** (blueprint `lem:ml2thinBallPositivity`(i)).

By (C4) each `W ∈ 𝕎_B` has affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` with the constant `bd.C₀`, and
`a ≥ δ > 0` by `cfg.hdims` and `cfg.hδ`, so `|W| ≳ r₁ b a > 0` by
`Convex.prod_thickness_le_volumeReal`. Consequently `∑_{W ∈ 𝒱} |W| > 0` for every nonempty
`𝒱 ⊆ 𝕎_B`, a finite sum of nonnegative terms with a positive one. -/

/-- **A ball carries at most as many segments as there are tubes.**

This is the reduction that makes the cardinality hypothesis of
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyCore_leApprox_one` — the budget check for the repaired
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply` — available inside the configuration, *without* adding a field
to `Kakeya.ThinCase.IsBallFactoring` or to `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData`: the families
`𝕋(T_B)` are pairwise disjoint, nonempty (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.fam_nonempty`) and contained in
`𝕋`, so they inject the segments of the ball into the tubes.

What remains of the hypothesis `|𝕋_B| ≤ δ^{-K}` after this reduction is `|𝕋| ≤ δ^{-K}`, a
property of the `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` tube family alone — the tubes are `δ`-separated in
directions inside the unit ball — and no longer of the per-ball factoring data. -/

/-! #### Positivity at a `c`-refinement of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`

Blueprint `lem:ml2thinBallPositivity`(ii)–(iii) records four separate positivity facts about a
`c`-refinement `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`, and in Lean each is its own
declaration — as for the sibling group `tangentialDenseSlabs_*` of blueprint
`lem:ml2tangentialDenseSlabs` — since the consumers use them one at a time and a conjunction
would force each to be projected out.

The four share the hypotheses `hc : 0 < c` and `href`, so they share a `variable` block. Part
(ii) of the blueprint — the same four conclusions for `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` itself — is the
instance `s' = (tc.thinBall hB).bodies'`, `W' = (tc.thinBall hB).W`, `c = 1`, where the
`c`-refinement hypothesis is the reflexive one; so parts (ii) and (iii) are the same four
statements read at two instances.

The common source of the mass bounds is (T2), `ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies`, which
bounds the fullness of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` below by `C⁻¹ δ^{2η} > 0`: with the convention that
a quotient by `0` is `0`, a positive fullness forces both its numerator and its denominator to
be positive, and the `c`-refinement then keeps a `c`-fraction of the mass. The volume bound is
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.volume_body_pos`, the bodies of a refinement being bodies of `𝕎_B`.
