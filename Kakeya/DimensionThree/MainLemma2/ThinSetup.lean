# The thin-case configuration of Main Lemma 2

This file formalizes blueprint Definition `hyp:ml2thinsetup` (the thin-case refinement of
Subsection `subsec:thincase`) and the lemmas that produce it.

The blueprint states the configuration globally, for all balls `B ∈ 𝔅` of the covering
family of Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` at once. Every lemma that *uses* it, however, first
fixes a ball `B ∈ 𝔅`, so we bundle the data per ball: `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` records,
for a single ball, the family `𝕋_B` of tube segments with its shading `Y_B`, the factoring
`𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}`, and the thin-case output `(Y'_B, 𝒮_B, 𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`
subject to (T1)–(T6). The uniformity in `B` demanded by the blueprint — a *single* pair of
constants serving for every ball — is expressed by making the comparison constant `C` a
*parameter* of the structure: the production lemma `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall` supplies a
value of `C` depending only on the ball-independent input constants.

The two genuinely global assertions of (T1) — that the amalgamated shading `Y'` on `𝕋` is
a `⪆ 1` refinement of `Y`, and the two-way compatibility of `Y'` with the per-ball `Y'_B` —
are the content of `Kakeya.ThinCase.globalShading` and `Kakeya.ThinCase.localToGlobal`,
which are stated directly in terms of the pieces `B̂` of the subordinate partition.

/-- **Constant in Definition `hyp:ml2thinsetup`**.

A constant `≥ 1` such that the shortest dimension `w₁ = τ₂(W)` of every body `W ∈ 𝕎_B`
satisfies `(w1Constant C₀)⁻¹ a ≤ w₁ ≤ w1Constant C₀ * a`; the radius used by every covering
argument of the thin case is then `A = w1Constant C₀ * a ≥ w₁`.

It is a function of the implicit constant `C₀` of the thickness comparison `τ₂(W) ∼ a` of
(C4) alone, and not of `δ`, of `B` or of `W`. The value `4 * C₀` is what the two hypotheses
of `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall` give: `HasThicknesses (Wb j).carrier C₀ ![r₁, b, a]` bounds
`τ₂(W) ≤ C₀ a`, and `w₁ ≤ 2 τ₂(W)`. The factor `4` rather than `2` is there because the
neighbourhood radius that the shading of the bodies actually comes with is `2 τ₂(W)` and not
`τ₂(W)`: the outer shaded bodies of the corrected factoring proposition are enlargements, and
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_outerShadeSubset` places their shade in the
`2 τ₂(W)`-neighbourhood of the shaded block. Accordingly `ThinBall.w_le` asks for
`2 τ₂(W) ≤ A`, which needs `2 C₀ ≤ w1Constant C₀`, and the remaining margin is what keeps
`w₁ ≤ A` available at the same time. The displayed value is provisional. -/

/-- **The thin-case configuration attached to one ball**.

Here `segs` indexes the family `𝕋_B` of tube segments of (C3) with shading `Y`
(the blueprint's `Y_B`), `bodies` indexes the family `𝕎_B` of factoring bodies of (C4),
`Wb` is the body itself and `blk` the block map of the factoring
`𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}`. The scale `a` is the shortest dimension of the bodies and
`δ` the thickness of the tubes; `η` is the density exponent.

The single constant `C` absorbs every `∼`, `≈`, `⪆` and `⪅` of (T1)–(T6); it is a
parameter, not a field, so that a statement quantified over the balls `B ∈ 𝔅` can demand
the *same* constant for every ball, as the amalgamation of the per-ball refinements
requires. The second constant `C₀` is the thickness comparison constant of (C3)/(C4); it
enters only through the radius `A = rad C₀ a` of blueprint `def:ml2thinW1Constant`, at which
(T4)(c) and (T6) are stated. -/

  /-- Upper half of the enlargement sandwich: the carrier of the shaded body is contained in
  the closed `τ₂(Wb j)`-neighbourhood of the geometric body. Together with `Wb_le_W` this is
  the construction-independent replacement of the (false) equality
  `(W j).toConvexSpaceBody = Wb j`: the outer shaded bodies of the corrected factoring
  proposition carry the enlargement `N_{τ₂(W)}(W)` as their carrier. Every downstream fact
  follows from the sandwich — volume control via
  `ConvexSpaceBody.volume_cthickening_le`, the thickness profile via
  `ConvexSpaceBody.hasThicknesses_of_between`, ball localisation and positivity — and neither
  field mentions `C`, so `ThinBall.mono` passes both through unchanged. -/
  W_le_cthickening : ∀ j ∈ bodies', (W j).toConvexSpaceBody ≤ (Wb j).cthickening (Wb j).scale
  /-- **(T2) the density bound `λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B}) ⪆ δ^{3η}`.**

  **Why `3η` and not `2η`.** The only route to this clause is the biased-factoring pipeline of
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply`, whose conjunct (i) is proved by transporting the input
  fullness `δ^η ≤ Cfull · λ(𝕋_B, Y_B)` through Frostman (`ConvexSpaceBody.IsFrostmanIn`) and the
  Córdoba density estimate, and that transport charges a `δ^{-η}` — the price of converting a
  *shade*-mass retention into the *carrier*-mass retention that
  `ConvexSpaceBody.IsFrostmanIn.of_le_of_subset` needs. So the honest output exponent is
  `η + η + η`, not `η + η`; the `δ^{-η}` is exhibited by the exact identity
  `θ³ (δ^η)³ C = 2 CF Cfull³ lam²` of that transport, not hidden in a constant.

  **Read at the index `2 · cfg.η`.** The (C5) clause
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_density` reads `c₁ δ^{2η}`, and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.tb` instantiates this structure at `η := 2 · cfg.η`; at a ball
  of the configuration this clause therefore reads `δ^{6 cfg.η}`, `denseBall` (T5) reads
  `C⁻¹ δ^{2 cfg.η}`, and the budgets below are read at that index (`slabDensity : 6η < exscal`
  from `η ≤ exscal/8`; the tangential chain at `8η`, `SlabMultKT.fullness_threshold : 9η ≤ η₁`;
  the transverse chain at `3τ + 7η`; the slab chain at the honest `11η + 10 exscal + 3τ` with the
  `4η` margin of `slabVolumeGoal` spent). The paragraphs below describe the move `2η ↝ 3η` of
  this field in its own index and are kept as its record.

  **The extra `η` is free.** `η` is chosen *last*, as a `min` of eight upper bounds
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams`), and every field of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` mentioning `η` bounds it from above only — its own
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.transverse` docstring says so, and records two earlier
  instances of exactly this move (`η+ϱ ↝ 2η+ϱ`, `3τ+9η ↝ 3τ+12η`). Raising a coefficient from
  `2` to `3` costs picking `η` two thirds as large, and the *choice* of `η` in
  `exists_caseParams` does not move at all: the only `CaseParams` field that has to follow is
  `slabDensity`, from `2η < exscal` to `3η < exscal`, and that is discharged from the
  **unchanged** `η ≤ exscal/4`.

  **What follows it, in full.** Three of the five sites that read this field are
  exponent-agnostic — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodiesNonempty`,
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinBallPositivity_nonempty` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinBallPositivity_shade_pos` use only `0 < δ^{2η}` through
  `ENNReal.rpow_pos`. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabPrismDensity` needs the hypothesis field
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabInputs.densityThreshold` (and its companion
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.density`) at `δ^{3η}`, which is the budget above.
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabBodyMassBound` propagates mechanically along the slab chain, and
  that chain lands inside `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams.slab`, which this move left
  unchanged at its then text `9η + 10exscal + 3τ < β/2`, spending `1η` of the `5η` of unused
  headroom it was carrying, so that `4η` remained. (The budget reads `12η + 12exscal + 3τ < β/2`: the extra `3η + 2exscal` is the explicit `δ^{2η}`
  loss of the repaired clause (T7), `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.segment_mass`, plus the
  fibre-count budget `δ^{-(η+2exscal)}` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale.fibreMass`; the `4η`
  of margin is kept — see the docstring of `CaseParams.slab`.) Two further readers each lose
  one `η` in their conclusion —
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.typicalAngleRefinedFullness` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialDensityChain`, `4η ↝ 5η` — which moves
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hfull` (no term-level users) and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsDenseSlab.dense`, and hence
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabMultKT.fullness_threshold` from `5η ≤ η₁` to `6η ≤ η₁` — a bound on
  the Katz–Tao exponent `η₁`, which is chosen after `η`, not on `η`.

  **Not re-indexing `ThinBall` at `3η/2`.** That would reach the same exponent here but would
  also weaken this structure's *other* `η`-field, `denseBall` (T5), which nothing asks for; and
  it would still be a field change, of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.tb`. Editing this one
  field is strictly better. -/

  whose body is shaded at `x`. -/

  constMult_bodies : HasCConstantMultiplicity bodies' W C
  /-- The common inner multiplicity of the blocks, appearing in (T4)(b). -/
  μinner : ℝ≥0
  /-- (T4)(b) each block `(𝕋_{B,W}, Y'_B)` has constant multiplicity, and this multiplicity
  is the same for all `W ∈ 𝕎'_B`. -/

      (μinner : ℝ≥0∞) ≤
        C * (pointwiseMultiplicity (segs.filter fun p => blk p = j) Y' x : ℝ≥0∞)
  /-- (T4)(c) the *centred* multiplicity statement at radius `A = C_{w₁} a`: the quantity
  `|U(𝕋_B, Y'_B) ∩ B(x, A)|` is the same up to a factor `≈ 1` for every `x` in
  `U(𝕋_B, Y'_B)`. The variant quantifying over all `A`-balls merely *meeting* the union is
  false: such a ball can touch the union tangentially. -/
  centredMult : ∀ x ∈ iUnionShade segs Y', ∀ y ∈ iUnionShade segs Y',
    volume (iUnionShade segs Y' ∩ ball x ((rad C₀ a : ℝ≥0) : ℝ)) ≤
      C * volume (iUnionShade segs Y' ∩ ball y ((rad C₀ a : ℝ≥0) : ℝ))
  /-- (T5) the typical-density estimate for the *final* shading: every segment of `𝒮_B`
  contains a `δ`-ball on which `Y'_B` has density `≳ δ^η`. -/
  denseBall : ∀ p ∈ S, ∃ x : E, (C : ℝ≥0∞)⁻¹ * (δ : ℝ≥0∞) ^ η *
    volume (ball x (δ : ℝ)) ≤ volume (ball x (δ : ℝ) ∩ (Y' p).shade)
  /-- The radius `w₁ = τ₂(W)` of the induced shading (T6), *per body*: it is the shortest
  dimension of the body `W` itself, i.e. `Metric.thickness ℝ (Wb j).carrier (finrank ℝ E - 1)`
  in the applications, as in `ShadedBody.inducedShading`. The bodies of `𝕎_B` have shortest
  dimension only *comparable* to `a`, not equal to it, so a single radius shared by all of
  them would be a genuine extra assumption. -/
  w : ω → ℝ
  /-- `2 * w j ≤ A = rad C₀ a` for every body of `𝕎'_B`, as in blueprint
  `def:ml2thinW1Constant`; this is the only property of `w` that the thin case uses. The
  doubled left-hand side is the radius that `shade_W_subset` below actually comes with, and it
  is what lets `Kakeya.ThinCase.bodiesInTubeNbhd` conclude `UW ⊆ N_A(U)` unchanged. -/
  w_le : ∀ j ∈ bodies', 2 * w j ≤ (rad C₀ a : ℝ)
  /-- (T6) `Y_{𝕎'_B}(W) ⊆ N_{2w₁}(U(𝕋_{B,W}, Y'_B))` at twice the per-body radius
  `w₁ = τ₂(W)`, as in blueprint `compatibilityOfShadingOnWWwithVV`.

  This one-sided containment replaces the former equality
  `(W j).shade = (Wb j).carrier ∩ N_{w j}(…)`, which is false for the corrected factoring
  proposition: its outer shaded bodies are genuine enlargements, their shade is
  `N_{w j}(Wb j) ∩ N_{2 w j}(…)` and need not lie in `Wb j` at all. The radius `2 * w j` is the
  one delivered by `ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_outerShadeSubset`, and the containment is
  all that any consumer uses. -/

`centredMult`) weaken by monotonicity of the product, and `denseBall`, where `C` is inverted,
weakens by the antitone inverse. Neither half of the enlargement sandwich (`Wb_le_W`,
`W_le_cthickening`) nor `shade_W_subset` mentions `C`, so all three are passed through
unchanged. This is what lets `Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupExists` pass from
the per-ball constant `perBallConstant` of `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall` to the global
`thinSetupConstant` without disturbing the data. -/

/-! ### Transfer along the enlargement

The five lemmas of this section are the only interface a consumer needs in order to work with
the *original* geometric bodies `Wb j` while the thin-case bundle actually carries the enlarged
outer carriers `(W j).toConvexSpaceBody`. Each is derived from the sandwich
`ThinBall.Wb_le_W` / `ThinBall.W_le_cthickening` alone, and from no property of the factoring
construction, so none of them has to be revisited when Proposition 5.1 is completed. -/

  [MeasurableSpace E] [BorelSpace E]

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2thinFactoringApply`.**

The comparison constant of the conclusions of `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply`: it is a
function of the Frostman constant `CF` of (C4) and of the constant `Cfull` in the fullness
hypothesis `δ^η ⪅ λ(𝕋_B, Y_B)`, and of the core envelope `Ccore` of the dyadic-pigeonhole
losses of Proposition 5.1 at the family in question. The displayed value is provisional.

**Why `Ccore` is present, and why the statement is false without it.** The former value
`max 1 (2 * volume_comparison.C 3 * CF * Cfull ^ 2)` — a function of `CF` and `Cfull` alone —
makes `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply` a *false* statement, in two independent ways.

The first is degenerate: with no `0 < δ`, no `δ ≤ w₁ ≤ 1`, no `1 ≤ CF` and `η` free, the
fullness hypothesis `δ^η ≤ Cfull * λ(𝕋_B, Y_B)` is satisfiable with `Cfull` arbitrarily small,
collapsing the constant to `1`; and at `C = 1` clause (vi) demands exact mass preservation and
clause (iv) exact pointwise maximality, which two far-separated unit balls with different shade
volumes refute. The `max Ccore` branch together with the binder `2 ≤ Ccore` closes this.

The second is robust, and is the reason `Ccore` must depend on the family and not only on the
constants. Take unit balls as bodies, pairwise separated by `10` times their radius, and split
them into `K` dyadic mass classes, class `i` holding `2^i` bodies of shade volume `V 2^{-i-1}`,
so that every class carries the same total mass `V / 2`. All the hypotheses hold at
`CF = Cfull = 1`. Clause (iv) then pins every positive retained mass into `[m, C m]`, so at most
`V / m` bodies contribute and `∑ v'_j ≤ C V`, while clause (vi) demands `∑ v'_j ≥ C⁻¹ K V / 2`.
Hence `K ≤ 2 C²`. Since `K` is free while `CF`, `Cfull`, `δ`, `η`, `w₁` and the dimension are all
fixed, *no* constant depending only on `CF` and `Cfull` can be correct; the necessary growth is
`C ≳ √(log₂ |𝕋_B|)`. The `max Ccore` branch closes this too, because
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyCore` dominates `⌊log₂ |𝕎_B|⌋ + 1` and
`(ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_refinement.c 3 |𝕋_B| δ)⁻¹ ≥ 4 (⌊log₂ |𝕋_B|⌋ + 1)^4`.

This is *not* a departure from GWZ. GWZ Proposition 5.1 states its items with `⪆`/`⪅`,
formalized in this repository as `Kakeya.LEApprox` — up to `ρ^{-ε}` for every `ε > 0` — which is
exactly what absorbs a dyadic pigeonhole logarithm. Pinning the constant to `CF` and `Cfull`
alone asserted something strictly *stronger* than GWZ, and that is why it was false. That the
repair stays inside the `⪅` budget is `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyCore_leApprox_one`.

Two factors beyond `CF * Cfull ^ 2 * Ccore` are carried because the outer bodies of the corrected
Proposition 5.1 are enlargements rather than the blocks themselves. The dimensional volume
comparison constant `volume_comparison.C 3`, which is the constant
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_volumeControlled.C 3` of the volume-controlled enlargement, is
what the passage from `volume (Wb j).carrier` to `volume (W j).carrier` costs in the density
conclusion (i); and the factor `2` is the one that
`ConvexSpaceBody.hasThicknesses_cthickening` charges for the thickness profile of the enlarged
carrier. `Cfull` enters *squared* because item (i) of the proposition produces a lower bound
proportional to `CF⁻¹ λ(𝕋_B, Y_B) ^ 2`. -/

/-! #### The bookkeeping clauses of `factoringApply`

Four of the thirteen conjuncts of `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply` are pure bookkeeping about the
*shape* of the outer bodies: the two halves of the enlargement sandwich, the pointwise containment
(ii), and the neighbourhood containment (v). They hold for the canonical choice of outer shaded
body below, and they hold for *every* refinement `(segs', Y')` of the input family, so nothing
about them depends on which refinement the quantitative clauses eventually force. They are
isolated here so that a proof of `factoringApply` has only the quantitative clauses (i), (iii),
(iv) — Items 2, 3, 4 and 7 of GWZ Proposition 5.1 — left to supply, and so that this much survives
independently of how those are settled. -/

/-- **Applying the factoring proposition in a single ball**.

The two hypotheses of blueprint Proposition `factoringAndMultPropCombined` hold for the
factoring `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}` of (C4): each block is `CF`-Frostman in its body
with `CF ∼ 1` (a maximal density factoring with bias still has Frostman constant `∼ 1`),
and by (C3) the members of `𝕋_B` have approximately equal dimensions. Reading off the
conclusions gives items (i)–(vi) below, at the common shortest dimension `w₁` of the
bodies.

Note that the proposition returns a *subfamily* `segs' ⊆ 𝕋_B`, and that item (vi)
produces the refinement only in the *summed* sense; both gaps are closed later, by
`extendByEmpty` and by `massMarkovUpgrade` respectively.

The bodies are *not* returned with carrier `Wb j`. The outer shaded bodies of the corrected
Proposition 5.1 carry the enlargement `N_{r_j}(Wb j)`, `r_j = τ₂(Wb j) = (Wb j).scale`, so the
output is described by the sandwich `Wb j ≤ (W j).toConvexSpaceBody ≤ (Wb j).cthickening
(Wb j).scale` and item (v) is a one-sided neighbourhood containment at radius `2 τ₂(Wb j)`.

**The `hloc`-free form of this statement is refuted.**
`Kakeya.ThinCase.Refute.factoringApply_refuted`
(`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/ThinFactoringRefute.lean`) derives `False` from
`Kakeya.ThinCase.Refute.FactoringApplyStatement`, which is this statement with `hloc` deleted
and everything else — the discretization hypotheses `hscale`, `hCcoreRef₀`, `hCcoreMult₀`
included — kept; `Kakeya.ThinCase.Refute.statement_of_universal_loc` is the tripwire, deriving
that `Prop` from this declaration by granting `hloc` universally and passing every other
argument verbatim. Items (iv) and (vi) are jointly unachievable with a
constant whose only inputs are `CF`, `Cfull`, `segs.card`, `bodies.card` and `δ`: one segment in
one long body, shaded on `M` pairwise `2 w₁`-separated blobs of harmonic mass, satisfies every
hypothesis below while forcing `∑_{k<M} (k+1)⁻¹ ≤ (factoringApplyConstant CF Cfull Ccore) ^ 2`.
The missing hypothesis is `ConvexSpaceBody.IsDiscretizedAtScale.subset_unitBall`, the first
field of `ShadedBody.FactorFamily.InnerIsDiscretizedAtScale`, which every item of the
Proposition 5.1 API assumes and which caps the number of `w₁`-balls needed to cover the shaded
union — the quantity the pigeonhole behind item (iv) actually pays for. See
`Kakeya.ThinCase.Localise.exists_localised_refinement_of_subset_ball` for the positive half.

The Proposition 5.1 API this should compose is, in the namespace `ShadedBody` of
`Kakeya/Factoring/Multiplicity.lean` (the one this file transitively imports): the carrier
sandwich is `ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_carrier`, which identifies the outer carrier with
`(Wb j).cthickening (Wb j).scale` outright, so both halves hold, the upper one with equality;
item (vi) is `ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_refinement`; item (i) is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_lambda`; item (iii)(a) is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_outerConstMultFat` (through
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringOuterRefined`); item (iii)(b) is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_innerConstMult`; item (ii) is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_shadingContainment`; and item (iv) is
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_avgMultOnBalls`, whose right-hand ball has radius `7 * w₁`,
not `w₁` — its own docstring records that the equal-radius form is false for the constructed
family, which is the drift this statement inherited.

Three names cited by earlier versions of this docstring —
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_outerBodyGe`,
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_volumeControlled` and
`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_hasThicknesses` — **do not exist anywhere in the tree**, and a
fourth, `ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_outerShadeSubset`, exists only in the un-imported
`ShadedBody.AtScale` namespace of `Kakeya/Factoring/MultiplicityAtScale.lean`. Item (v) has no
deliverer in the imported namespace.

The output constant is the *explicit* `factoringApplyConstant CF Cfull Ccore`, not an
existentially quantified one: an existential constant would be allowed to depend on the ball
`B`, and the ball-independence of `perBallConstant` — on which the amalgamation of the per-ball
refinements rests — could then not be derived.

`Ccore` is a *parameter* subject to the four envelope binders, not a formula in `segs.card`,
`bodies.card` and `δ`. So the envelope formula
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApplyCore` may change without touching this statement or any
downstream one, and what the amalgamation actually needs — ball-*uniformity*, one constant for
all balls, and not cardinality-independence — is achieved by quantification: see
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_thinConfig`, which instantiates `Ccore` with the supremum over the
finitely many balls of the canonical envelope at that ball. Cardinality-independence is not
available and is not needed: `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.tb` takes one `C` for all balls,
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.mono` only weakens upward, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.C` is an existential field, so no downstream statement pins
the shape of the constant.

**Proof route.** The plain Proposition 5.1 API named above is *not* what the proof composes:
the thin case runs the **weighted** pipeline through `Kakeya.ThinCase.exists_factoringApplyData`
(`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.ThinAssembly`), which delivers all thirteen conjuncts at
explicit constants — item (i) by GWZ's Item 2 accounting over a fibre-density band, item (iv) by
the finer ball net, item (v) from the cell shading's defining equation. What remains here is the
envelope: (iii)(a)/(b) at `2 ≤ Ccore`, and (i), (iv), (vi) at the four branches of
`Kakeya.ThinCase.thinEnvelopeTerm`, which `hCcoreNet` dominates; the six binders `hCcoreRef`,
`hCcoreMult`, `hCcoreDyad`, `hCcoreFrost`, `hCcoreRef₀`, `hCcoreMult₀` are not consumed by this
proof (the pipeline losses they price are folded into the uniform retained fraction inside
`thinEnvelopeTerm`). -/

The two lemmas of this section are pure bookkeeping and use neither the inner product, nor
finite-dimensionality, nor the Borel structure of `E`; they are stated with the weakest
typeclass assumptions under which they make sense, so that they can be reused verbatim in
other settings. -/

/-- **Extending the factoring shading by `∅`**.

Extending the shading produced on the subfamily `segs'` to all of `segs` by the empty set
changes none of the three quantities the conclusions of `factoringApply` speak about: the
shaded unions (globally and blockwise), the pointwise multiplicities, and the total mass.
Consequently items (i)–(vi) hold verbatim with `segs'` replaced by `segs`. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2thinCentredMult`.**

The comparison constant produced by `Kakeya.ThinCase.centredMult`: covering an `A`-ball by
`w₁`-balls centred at a maximal `w₁`-separated subset costs a factor bounded in terms of the
ratio bound `A ≤ C₁ w₁` and the dimension `n` only, and the comparison at radius `w₁` costs
the factor `C`. The displayed value is provisional. -/
noncomputable def centredMultConstant (C C₁ : ℝ≥0) (n : ℕ) : ℝ≥0 :=
  max 1 (C * (4 * C₁) ^ n)


/-- **The centred multiplicity statement at radius `A`**.

The factoring proposition compares `|U ∩ B(x, w₁)|` across the points of the larger union
`UW = U(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`. Covering an `A`-ball by boundedly many `w₁`-balls centred at a
maximal `w₁`-separated subset of `U ∩ B(x, A)` — each of whose points lies in `U ⊆ UW` —
upgrades this to a comparison of `|U ∩ B(x, A)|` across the points of `U`, at the radius
`A ∼ w₁` actually used by the thin case.

The output constant is the *explicit* `centredMultConstant`: the number of `w₁`-balls needed
depends on the ratio `A / w₁` and on the ambient dimension, but not on `U`, so an
existentially quantified constant would needlessly be allowed to depend on the ball. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2thinPerBall`.**

The comparison constant of the `ThinBall` produced by `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall`: it is a
function of the thickness comparison constant `C₀` of (C3), the Frostman constant `CF` of
(C4), the density constant `c₁` of (C5) and the overlap constant `D` of the `δ`-ball covers
alone, and in particular does not depend on the ball `B`. This ball-independence is what
makes the amalgamation of the per-ball refinements possible.

The displayed value is provisional, but it is built so as to dominate each of the losses the
proof of `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall` actually incurs, so that `ThinBall.one_le_C` and (T1)–(T6)
are not made unprovable by an accidentally too small constant. It is a four-way `max`:

* the cap `1`, so that `1 ≤ perBallConstant` holds unconditionally — without it the value
  would be `< 1` as soon as `c₁ > 1`, which the hypotheses of `perBall` permit;
* `2 * factoringApplyConstant CF c₁⁻¹ Ccore`, the factor `2` of the mass–Markov upgrade
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.massMarkovUpgrade` applied to the loss
  `factoringApplyConstant CF c₁⁻¹ Ccore` of `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply` (whose fullness
  constant is `c₁⁻¹` there, and which enters *squared*, so this term is already of size
  `c₁⁻²`);
* `centredMultConstant (factoringApplyConstant CF c₁⁻¹ Ccore) (8 * C₀ ^ 2) 3`, the loss of
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.centredMult` at the ratio bound `rad C₀ a ≤ 8 C₀² w₁` supplied by (C4)
  (and hence cubic in `C₀`); the ratio is `8 C₀²` and no longer `4 C₀²` because
  `w1Constant C₀ = max 1 (4 C₀)` now carries the factor `2` of the neighbourhood radius of
  `ThinBall.shade_W_subset`;
* `2 * (D + 1) * tubeSegmentNbhdConstant C₀ * c₁⁻¹ * centredMultConstant …`, the reciprocal
  of the `δ`-ball density constant `deltaBallConstant D C₀ c c₁`, which is what (T5) asks
  for (with `c = perBallConstant …⁻¹`).

Taking each term of the outer `max` separately — rather than one product carrying the
`c₁⁻¹` shrink factors — is essential: the `c₁⁻¹` factors can shrink without bound (the
hypotheses of `perBall` only require `0 < c₁`, not `c₁ ≤ 1`), so a single product containing
them would fail to dominate the `2 * factoringApplyConstant …` and `centredMultConstant …`
terms once `c₁` is large. -/

/-- **Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, clauses (C3)–(C5), at a single ball.**

The hypotheses that Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` makes about one ball `B ∈ 𝔅` of the covering
family, in the form `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall` consumes them: the family `segs = 𝕋_B` of tube
segments with shading `Y = Y_B`, the factoring `𝕋_B = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝕎_B} 𝕋_{B,W}` over
`bodies = 𝕎_B` with block map `blk` and bodies `Wb`, and the four scales `δ ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r₁`
together with the shortest body dimension `w₁ ∼ a`.

The clauses are grouped as in the blueprint. `blk_mem` and `le_block` say that the factoring
is a factoring; `thick` and `dims` are (C3), the affine thicknesses `∼ (r₁, δ, δ)` of the
segments and their pairwise comparability; `body`, `width` and `frostman` are (C4), the
thicknesses `∼ (r₁, b, a)` of the bodies, the comparability of their shortest dimension with
`w₁`, and the Frostman condition of the blocks; `dens` is (C5), the per-segment density bound
`|Y_B(T_B)| ≥ c₁ δ^η |T_B|`.

The three scale and constant clauses `one_le_C₀`, `one_le_CF`, `c₁_pos`, the ordering
`δ_pos`–`b_le_r₁` and `segs_nonempty` are fields rather than separate binders of `perBall`
because they are exactly the standing assumptions of `hyp:ml2setup` on the data this
structure is about, and because none of them is derivable from the others.

`dims` — the segments of `𝕋_B` have pairwise comparable affine thicknesses with the *numerical*
factor `2` — is the second hypothesis of `ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCombined`, and it is
*not* derivable from `thick`: the thickness vector comparison only bounds
`τ_i(Y p) ≤ C₀² τ_i(Y q)`, and nothing trades `C₀²` for `2`.

`c₁_pos` is essential and not cosmetic. With `c₁ = 0` the clause `dens` is vacuous, so `Y`
may be everywhere unshaded, and then the fields `ThinBall.S_nonempty` and `ThinBall.denseBall`
of the conclusion of `perBall` are contradictory. It is also what supplies the fullness
constant `Cfull := c₁⁻¹` when `Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply` is invoked. -/

For each tube segment `T_B ∈ 𝕋_B`, a `D`-boundedly overlapping cover `𝒞(T_B)` of its carrier
by `δ`-balls, every one of which meets the carrier. This is the input of the averaging step
that produces clause (T5) of Definition `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, and it is data — the index type of
the balls, their centres, and the assignment of a cover to each segment — so it is bundled as
a structure rather than as a predicate.

`one_le_D` belongs here because `D` is the overlap constant of *these* covers and of nothing
else. -/

/-- **The thin-case refinement in a single ball** (blueprint `lem:ml2thinPerBall`, together
with the `δ`-ball estimate of `lem:ml2thinDeltaBall` which supplies (T5)).

Applying the factoring proposition (`factoringApply`), extending its shading by `∅`
(`extendByEmpty`), upgrading its summed refinement to a termwise one on a large subfamily
(`massMarkovUpgrade`) and passing from radius `w₁` to radius `A` (`centredMult`) produces
the data of Definition `hyp:ml2thinsetup` for the ball, with a constant that does not
depend on the ball.

Two temptations must be resisted, and both would break the composition with
`Kakeya.ThinCase.lift`: one must not pass to `𝒮_B` and rename it `𝕋_B`, and one must not
truncate `Y'_B` to `∅` off `𝒮_B`. Keeping `Y'_B` on all of `𝕋_B` and recording `𝒮_B`
separately avoids both.

The field `ThinBall.w_le`, i.e. `2 * w j ≤ rad C₀ a` for the per-body radius `w j = τ₂(W_j)` of
(T6), is *not* a hypothesis here: it is derived from `hfac.body`, which gives
`2 τ₂(W_j) ≤ 2 C₀ a ≤ w1Constant C₀ * a` by the definition of `w1Constant C₀ ≥ 2 C₀`. Assuming
it separately would make the lemma vacuous whenever the two constants disagree.

Only three of the binders are hypotheses. `hdim` fixes the ambient dimension;
`hfac : Kakeya.ThinCase.IsBallFactoring …` is clauses (C3)–(C5) of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup` at this ball, together with the standing constant and scale conditions they
are stated under; and `bc : Kakeya.ThinCase.DeltaBallCovers …` is the (T5) `δ`-ball cover data.
Everything else — `segs`, `Y`, `bodies`, `Wb`, `blk`, the scales `δ, a, b, r₁, w₁`, the
exponent `η` and the constants `C₀, CF, c₁, D` — is the data the conclusion is about. See
those two structures for what each clause says and why none of them is derivable from the
others. -/

/-- **The global shading of (T1)**.

The per-ball shadings `Y'_B` are amalgamated into a single global shading on `𝕋` by
`Y'(T) = ⨆_{B ∈ 𝔅} (Y(T) ∩ Y'_B(T_B) ∩ B̂)`, with `T_B` the unique parent segment of `T`
in `B`. This is a `⪆ 1` refinement of `(𝕋, Y)`, and `Y'(T) ∩ B̂ ⊆ Y'_B(T_B)`.

Insisting on a *single* global shading — rather than one refined separately in each ball —
is what allows the slab case to sum its estimate over all `B ∈ 𝔅`. -/

/-- **Constant in Lemma `lem:ml2thinsetupexists`.**

The comparison constant of the data produced by `Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupExists`. Each ball
contributes the loss `perBallConstant C₀ CF c₁ Ccore D` of `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall`, and the
amalgamation `Kakeya.ThinCase.amalgamateCost` of the per-ball refinements composes it with
itself once, since `Kakeya.ThinCase.lift` is applied with `c = κ = (perBallConstant …)⁻¹`;
this is the factor `perBallConstant C₀ CF c₁ Ccore D ^ 2`.

The remaining factor `Cm ^ 2` is the loss of `Kakeya.ThinCase.lift` itself: the passage from
the per-ball shadings to the global one goes through the fibre count of
`Kakeya.ThinCase.liftFibre`, which is used twice — once for `Y_B` and once for `Y'_B` — and
each use costs the comparison constant `Cm` of the (C5) fibre-count hypothesis
`|𝕋(T_B)_Y(x)| ≈ m`. This dependence is *not* removable and must not be hidden inside a
`⪆`: the fibre count is what relates the mass of the global shading on the piece `B̂` to the
mass of the per-ball shading, and without a bound on it the amalgamated refinement carries no
information at all. The displayed value is otherwise provisional. -/

/-- **The thin-case configuration can be arranged**.

Assuming Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` — here spelled out as the per-ball data of (C3),
(C4), (C5) together with the subordinate partition of (C2) — there is data realizing
Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` for the *same* pair `(𝕋, Y)`: a single global shading `Y'`
on `𝕋` which is a `⪆ 1` refinement of `Y`, and, for every ball `B ∈ 𝔅`, a
`Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall` with the *same* comparison constant, compatible with `Y'` in both
directions.

The pair `(𝕋, Y)` itself is not modified: `Y'` is auxiliary data attached to it.

Two features of the statement matter. First, the constant is the *explicit*
`thinSetupConstant C₀ CF c₁ D`, so it is one and the same in every ball and the losses in the
different balls do not compound; an existentially quantified constant would be allowed to
depend on the ball, and a bound with `B`-dependent constants would be worthless when the
per-ball refinements are amalgamated. (This is the same point as in the docstring of
`Kakeya.ThinCase.factoringApply`.) Second, the `δ`-ball estimate (T5) is read off *after* the
factoring proposition has been applied, so that no subsequent shrinking of the shading can
invalidate it; being a pure averaging statement it leaves (T1)–(T4) and (T6) untouched.

The thin-case hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` of blueprint Definition `hyp:ml2thinsetup` is *not*
assumed: none of (T1)–(T6) uses it. It first enters in
`Kakeya.ThinCase.unionLower_thin` and `Kakeya.ThinCase.transfer_thin`, where it is a
hypothesis.

As in `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall`, the positivity `0 < c₁` of the density constant of (C5) is
essential: with `c₁ = 0` the hypothesis `hdens` is vacuous and the `ThinBall` demanded by the
conclusion cannot exist for an everywhere unshaded `Y`. The hypothesis `hdims` is likewise
the one of `Kakeya.ThinCase.perBall`, quantified over the balls.

The (C5) fibre-count data — the scale `m`, the comparison constant `Cm ≥ 1` and the
hypothesis `hfibre` asserting `|𝕋(T_B)_Y(x)| ≈ m` on `Y_B(T_B)` — is not decoration. The
refinement conclusion is reached only through `Kakeya.ThinCase.lift`, hence through
`Kakeya.ThinCase.liftFibre`, and without a bound on the fibre count it is *false*: a segment
`T_B ∉ 𝒮_B` whose family `𝕋(T_B)` is arbitrarily large contributes arbitrarily much to
`∑_T |Y(T)|` while `Y'` gains nothing from it, so the loss in the third conjunct of the
conclusion is unbounded. Accordingly `Cm` appears explicitly in
`Kakeya.ThinCase.thinSetupConstant`.

The segment-mass inequality (T7) of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup` is not produced here: it is
a *theorem* of the data this lemma returns, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.segment_mass_of_compat`. The former pass-through `{mass}`/`hsegmass`, a consumer-dead binder whose
sole caller instantiated it at `mass := 0`, was removed by pack F14; the
statements with and without it are equivalent. The `ThinBall` family is produced as a single
existential rather than one per ball because (T7) is a statement about all the balls at once. -/
