# The typical-angle package at a ball

This file carries the single bundle `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData`, the output of
blueprint Proposition `lem:ml2typicalangle` at a ball `B ∈ 𝔅` of Configuration
`hyp:ml2setup`: a presentation of the factoring family `𝕎'_B` as a family of planks, a
`⪆ 1` refinement `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})` of `(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})`, and an angle `θ ∈ [a/b, 1]`
that is typical for the refinement.

It lives in its own file because it is produced in one place
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`, in
`Kakeya.DimensionThree.MainLemma2.NonSlabCase`) and consumed in two mutually incomparable
ones — the transverse leaf `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge` and the tangential
leaf `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_lt` — so neither of those files can be the home
of the definition.

/-- **The normal of a convex body of `ℝ³`, at the ambient dimension**: `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal`
with the proof `finrank_euclideanSpace_fin`
of `dim ℝ³ = 3` supplied once.

Folding it into a definition of its own is not cosmetic. Elaborating
`NonSlab.bodyNormal finrank_euclideanSpace_fin _` at `E := EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` costs the
`finrank` proof plus five instance searches, and the tangential argument mentions the normal
dozens of times — in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`, in the packing argument of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` and in every `Finset.image` and `Set.InjOn`
around it. Written out, those occurrences exhaust the heartbeat budget of a single
declaration; folded, they do not. Keep it folded: use `norm_bodyNormal`,
`bodyNormal_ne_zero` and `axisAngle_eq_lineAngle` rather than `simp`/`unfold`. -/

/-- **The angle between the normals of two convex bodies of `ℝ³`**: `∠(n(W), n(W'))`, the quantity
the blueprint writes `∠(v(W), v(W'))`
throughout the tangential subsubsection, with `n(·) = Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyNormal` the rank-`2`
direction of the outer prism — the direction of *smallest* affine thickness — and the angle
taken between the *lines* `ℝ n(W)`, `ℝ n(W')`, so that the sign ambiguity of `bodyNormal` is
harmless.

**Why the normal and not the long axis.** This definition used to read
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyAxis`, the rank-`0` direction, i.e. the *longest* half-width. That was a
mismatch with the only hypothesis that ever bounds this quantity between two bodies, the
typicality `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.htyp`: `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` measures
angles through `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle`, hence through `Kakeya.Prism3D.angle`, which is
`arccos |⟪P₁.basis 0, P₂.basis 0⟫|`; and for `Plank a b = Prism3D a b 1` with `a ≤ b ≤ 1` the
half-widths are *ascending*, so `basis 0` is the smallest of them — the plank's normal. Since
`Metric.thickness` is antitone in the rank, the matching direction of a body is
`outerPrism.basis 2`, not `outerPrism.basis 0`. The two are different quantities in `ℝ³` and
no bound on one gives a bound on the other, so the old reading left the typicality hypothesis
inapplicable to the bodies. Blueprint `note:ml2slabAxisSeparationCorrection` already
identified the normal as the direction that separates two slabs; the Lean now reads it.

`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyAxis` is *not* obsolete: it remains the right direction where a body is
compared with a tube of one of its blocks (`Kakeya.NonSlab.lineAngle_bodyAxis_le`, used in
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/MainLemma2/NonSlabSplit.lean`). Only the tangential subsubsection
changes.

**Why it lives here and not in `TangentialCase.lean`.** It is read by the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle` below as well as by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabFamily`, and this file is upstream of both consumers.

The abbreviation is a Lean convenience, for the reason recorded on
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyNormal`: it keeps the expensive term folded at the dozens of places
where the tangential argument reads an angle. -/

/-- `axisAngle` unfolded onto `Kakeya.NonSlab.lineAngle`, as a `rfl`-lemma. Rewriting with this
is far cheaper than `simp [axisAngle]`: it keeps `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.bodyNormal` folded, and
so avoids re-elaborating `finrank_euclideanSpace_fin` and the five instance searches around it
at every occurrence. That cost is the reason both abbreviations exist. -/

/-- **The angle between two prisms built on the bodies' own frames is the bodies' angle.**

`Kakeya.Prism3D.angle` is `arccos |⟪P.basis 0, Q.basis 0⟫|` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle` is `Kakeya.NonSlab.lineAngle` of the two normals, which is the
same `arccos` by `Kakeya.NonSlab.lineAngle_eq_arccos_abs_inner`; and the rank-`0` vector of
`Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyFrame` *is* the normal, by `Kakeya.NonSlab.bodyFrame_zero`.

This is the identity that turns the typicality of the plank angles produced by
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` into the display `anglebound`, i.e. into the
field `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hangle`. Its hypotheses are exactly what the

/-- **The typical angle of intersection, with its plank presentation and its refinement**
(blueprint Proposition `lem:ml2typicalangle`, `def:typicalAnglePlank`).

At a ball `B ∈ 𝔅` this is the whole output of blueprint `lem:ml2typicalangle`, produced by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` and consumed verbatim by both angular
leaves and by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`. Its three groups of fields are:

* the *plank presentation* `P` of `𝕎'_B = (tc.thinBall hB).bodies'` as a family of
  `a' × b' × 1` planks with the same aspect ratio, `hratio : a'/b' = a/b`, together with the
  clause `hwin` that `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` needs and that a freely given plank family
  cannot supply; an essential-distinctness clause `hPed`
  stood beside it until R26 deleted that field;
* the *refinement* `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`, recorded as the shading `YW` on the same index set
  together with `hrefine` and the refinement factor `c ≥ δ^{2η}` of `hc` — this
  development's rendering of `⪆ 1`, `η` being the smallest positive exponent of the section
 — and the fullness `hfull` of the
  refined pair, which is asserted here, where `YW` is produced, rather than assumed by a
  consumer;
* the *angle* `θ ∈ [a'/b', 1]` and its typicality constant `Ctyp`, with the two-sided bound
  `hCtyp1 : 1 ≤ Ctyp` / `hCtyp : Ctyp ≤ (δ^{1-exscal})^{-η/256}` on that constant and the
  typicality `htyp` itself. The lower bound is what makes `Ctyp` a genuine *loss*, in the
  sense of the constant/exponent convention ; it costs the producer
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` nothing, since both
  `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` and `ShadedBody.HasCConstantMultiplicity` only weaken as the
  constant grows and the upper bound `(δ^{1-exscal})^{-η/256}` is itself `≥ 1`, so the
  constant `C` returned by `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` may be replaced by
  `max 1 C`. It is used in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount`, whose cone
  aperture step is `∠(n(S), n(W₁)) ≤ 2θ + Ctyp θ ≤ 3 Ctyp θ` (the slab clause (S3) being read
  at `2θ`), and hence in the lower bound `1 ≤ Cμ` recorded in
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.IsSlabDecompMultConstant`.

Bundling is what keeps the two angular leaves and `tangentialSlabDecomp` from each
re-listing fourteen binders; the alternative was three verbatim copies of this list.

The angle clause is stated at `a'/b'` and not at `a/b`, matching the form in which
`Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale` produces it; `hθab'` below converts it using
`hratio`.

The bundle is indexed by the transverse parameter `τ'` because its fullness clause `hfullP` is
asserted only under the transverse-case guard `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ θ`, the sole regime in which GWZ invoke Lemma 6.13 and the only place the clause
is read. -/

  /-- **The refined pair retains the fullness of (T2), at the exponent `8η`.**

  This is (T2), `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies` — `δ^{6η} ≤ C λ(𝕎'_B, Y_{𝕎'_B})` at
  the `tb` index `2η` — propagated through the `c`-refinement of `hrefine`, which costs the
  second factor `δ^{2η}` by `hc` and `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.mul_fullness_le`. The two factors
  are independent and neither can be dropped, which is why the exponent is `8η` and not `6η`;
  the same exponent appears for the same reason in `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabDecomp`.

  **Why it is not `(a')^η ≤ λ(𝕊*, Y_{𝕎''_B})`.** That is the form
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` wants, and it is the form this field used to carry, but it
  is not reachable from Configurations `hyp:ml2setup` and `hyp:ml2thinsetup`: `a' ≥ δ/r₁` by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankPresentationData.hδa'`, so `(a')^η ≥ δ^{(1-exscal)η}`, whereas
  the largest lower bound on the fullness available anywhere in the configuration is the
  `δ^{6η}` of (T2), and `(1-exscal)η < 6η`. The gap is a positive power of `δ`, so no constant
  and no smallness hypothesis on `δ` can close it — shrinking `δ` makes it worse. The
  blueprint records the same computation in the closing note of `lem:ml2typicalangle` ("what
  this proposition does *not* produce") and concludes that the `(a')^η` fullness is a
  mathematical input required of whatever produces the bodies, not of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`. What this field carries is therefore the
  strongest fullness the producer can actually supply.

  **The exponent is `8η`.** It follows
  `Kakeya.ThinCase.ThinBall.fullness_bodies`, which is asserted at `δ^{3η}` in the structure's
  own index `η` (see that field for why `3η` is the honest value there) and is read by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThinConfig.tb` at the index `2 · cfg.η`, the (C5) exponent in the density clause, i.e. at `δ^{6η}`: the chain here is `δ^{2η}` from `hc` times
  `δ^{6η}` from (T2). This field has no term-level users, so nothing downstream spends it.

  **What that costs downstream.** `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFill` asks the plank-to-slab
  reduction for a conclusion at `δ^{5η}`, and this field is not enough for it at *any* exponent
  `η'` at which the reduction may be invoked: the fullness hypothesis `(a')^{η'} ≤ λ` together
  with `a' ≤ C₀ δ^{1-τ-exscal}` forces `η' > 8η`, while the conclusion together with
  `a' ≥ δ^{1-exscal}` and `exscal < 1/2` forces `η' < 5η/2`. So restating this field was not a
  reformulation of the transverse input but the removal of it: the `(a')^η` form is now absent
  from the development, and `transverseFill` cannot be closed until it is threaded in from
  where the factoring bodies are produced. Its docstring carries the computation. -/

  /-- **(GWZ 6.13's transport datum) the plank-angle bound over each shade fibre at the
  *absolute* constant `1`**: for every shaded point, the maximal effective plank angle over the
  indices shading it is at most `θ` itself, with no constant.

  **This is not a new assumption. It is information the tree already derives and was throwing
  away.** It is the last conclusion clause of
  `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_perScale`, produced at `C = 1` in the rescaled
  coordinates, and until now it was consumed at the Section-6 → Section-9 interface by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle_of_maxPlankAngleBound` — which spends it and returns only
  `hangle`, the **body**-axis form at the **non-absolute** `Ctyp` — and then discarded. The
  producer already has it in hand; this field records it.

  **Why the `Ctyp`-scaled clauses cannot replace it.** `htyp` above gives
  `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound sel YW P θ Ctyp` through
  `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.hasMaxPlankAngleBound`, and that is the wrong side: `Ctyp` is
  bounded only by `(δ')^{-η/256}` (`hCtyp`), which is *unbounded* as `δ → 0`, so no smallness
  hypothesis on `δ` recovers an absolute constant from it. GWZ 6.13's radius transport needs the
  angle controlled by `θ` alone; see
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.effectivePlankAngle_le_of_hasMaxPlankAngleBound_one`, which is exactly
  what this field unlocks and what the `Ctyp` form does not give.

  It is recorded for the stored shading `YW` and the stored planks `P`, i.e. in the original
  coordinates; `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.HasMaxPlankAngleBound.congr_image` is the transport that
  carries it there from the rescaled coordinates at the same constant, and it costs nothing —
  `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound` sees a shading only through `shadeFibre`. -/
  hmaxAbs : Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound sel YW P θ 1
  /-- **Typicality read on the bodies**: two bodies of `𝕎''_B`
  sharing a shaded point have normals at angle at most `C_{lem:ml2typicalangle} θ`.

  This is the display `\eqref{anglebound}` that the blueprint proof of
  `lem:ml2tangentialSlabFibreCount` opens with, and it is the only form in which that lemma
  uses typicality.

  **Why it is a field and not a consequence of `htyp`.** The blueprint identifies each body
  `W ∈ 𝕎''_B` with the plank enclosing `L_B(W)` and reads one angle off both. In Lean the two
  are distinct data and the identification is *not available*:

  * `htyp` bounds `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle (P i) (P j)`, i.e. the angle between
    `(P i).basis 0` and `(P j).basis 0`;
  * `axisAngle (bd.Wb i) (bd.Wb j)` is the angle between `outerPrism.basis (bd.Wb i) 2` and
    `outerPrism.basis (bd.Wb j) 2`.

  The planks are produced by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` through
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankWindowEnclosure` and
  `Kakeya.Prism3D.exists_superset_of_hasThicknesses`, and that last one builds its prism on
  `(outerPrism.basis h3 hK hKne).reindex Fin.revPerm` for `K = L_B '' (bd.Wb j).carrier` — the
  frame of the *rescaled* body. So `(P j).basis 0` is the outer-prism normal of `L_B(W)`,
  while `axisAngle` reads that of `W`, and `Metric.outerPrism.basis` is choice-derived (a
  cluster point selected in `outerPrism.exists_limit`) with no equivariance under the
  homothety `L_B` and no rigidity: for a body two of whose affine thicknesses are comparable
  the witnessing frame is not determined even up to a small angle. Moreover the two existential
  statements between the construction and here discard the frame altogether, so no consumer of
  `plankPresentation` can name `(P j).basis` at all.

  The gap is *not* absorbable by a quantitative comparison. The enclosure
  `L_B '' (bd.Wb j).carrier ⊆ (P j).carrier` together with (C4) pins the two normals only to
  within an angle `≍ C(bd.C₀) · a/b`, and the aperture budget of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.tangentialSlabFibreCount` has no room for it: that lemma must reach
  `∠ ≤ 3 Ctyp δ^{-τ'} a/b` from `∠ ≤ 2θ + Ctyp θ` (the slab clause (S3) at `2θ`), and the only slack is `2 (Ctyp - 1) θ`, which vanishes at `Ctyp = 1`. So an
  additive `C(bd.C₀) a/b ≤ C(bd.C₀) θ` breaks the constant
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.slabDecompFibreConstant` exactly.

  Recording `anglebound` here is therefore the faithful rendering: it is what the blueprint
  means by "θ is typical for `(𝕎''_B, Y_{𝕎''_B})`" when the family is read as bodies rather
  than as planks. The obligation lands on the producer
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`, which is proved and discharges it through
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.axisAngle_of_maxPlankAngleBound`: the planks of its presentation are
  built on the frame of the body (`hbasis : (P i).basis = bodyFrame (Wb i)`), which is the
  route described next, and the field is returned at the constant `Ctyp` (that lemma asks
  `2 ≤ Ctyp`, and spends the absolute-constant form recorded as `hmaxAbs` above). The route:
  have `plankWindowEnclosure` build the plank on a *prescribed* frame, so that
  `plankPresentation` can hand it the frame of `bd.Wb j` itself, transported unchanged by the
  homothety `L_B`; then `(P j).basis 0 = NonSlab.bodyNormal (bd.Wb j)` on the nose and this
  field follows from `htyp`. -/

  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` consumes a plank family *with its shading
  attached*, and its refinement hypothesis `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement` demands the carriers of
  the refining family to be *equal* to the planks. The pair `(P, YW)` above cannot serve: `P`
  is a bare plank family and `YW` carries the original-coordinate bodies. So the producer
  hands over the packaged family as well; re-running
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation` at the consumer would produce a *fresh* family and
  not the one the angle `θ` was found for. -/

  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverseFill_threshold` at `(ShadedPlank.planks SP, YP)`, and no
  other field of this structure relates `YP` to `YW` — `hPrefine` refines `YP` against
  `ShadedPlank.bodies SP`, not against `YW`. So `hmaxAbs` does not reach the call site and this
  field is needed in addition to it, not instead of it.

  Like `hPtyp` beside it, it costs nothing at the producer: the constructor holds the
  rescaled-coordinate bound `hmax` and `YP` is built from the same shading, so
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.shadedPlankOf_hasMaxPlankAngleBound` carries it across exactly as
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.shadedPlankOf_isTypicalPlankAngle` carries `hPtyp`.

  **Why the `Ctyp`-scaled clause cannot replace it.** `hPtyp` gives
  `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound sel YP (ShadedPlank.planks SP) θ Ctyp` through
  `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.hasMaxPlankAngleBound`, and `Ctyp` is bounded only by
  `(δ')^(-(η/256))`, which is unbounded as `δ → 0`. Both consumers —
  `Plank.exists_slabCover_of_absoluteAngle`, which asks at the literal constant `2`, and
  `Plank.localAngleConcentration_of_preassemblyData`, whose angle constant is bound *before* the
  configuration — require a constant fixed before `a`. -/
  hmaxAbsP : Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound sel YP (ShadedPlank.planks SP) θ 1
  /-- **(O5) In the transverse case, the plank family is `(a')^η`-full**.

  This is the fullness hypothesis `λ(𝒫, Y) ≥ a^η` of GWZ Lemma 6.13 (GWZ), the
  hypothesis of `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle`, and it is *not* derivable from
  (T2) — GWZ (95), `λ ⪆ δ^{2η}`: see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.TypicalAngleData.hfull`
  below for the computation showing that the two exponents differ by a positive power of `δ`.
  It is a mathematical input of the branch, required of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, and it
  reaches `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank` as the clause
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverseFill_fullness`.

  It is asserted only under the transverse-case guard `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ θ` (GWZ), which is
  where GWZ invoke Lemma 6.13 and the only place this field is read
  (`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFillPlankEstimate`, hypothesis `htrans`); the tangential
  leaf never reads it. With `hθ1` the guard yields `δ^{-τ'} a/b ≤ 1`, the guard of the
  `CaseScale` clause, which is how the producer discharges this field. -/

  `C₀` of (C4); this is what `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseFillTransport` consumes as its

  `r₁ θ b'` only up to that constant -/

  rescaled scale -/

  /-- **The rescaling bridge at the unrefined plank family, in subset form**.

  A subfamily of `(𝒫, Y_𝒫)` — recorded through its shadings alone, since
  `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` produces it with the *plank* carriers —
  pulls back to a subfamily of `(𝕊*, Y_{𝕎'_B})`, transporting local volume estimates with the
  radii multiplied by `2 r₁`, the normalizing scale of the plank presentation (the shaded
  bodies of the factoring proposition are enlargements of the geometric bodies of (C4) and do
  not fit in `B̄(ctr, r₁)`; see `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankPresentation`).

  This is the level the reduction's output lives at: that lemma concludes
  `ShadedBody.IsRefinement s' Y' s (ShadedPlank.bodies Y)`, i.e. a refinement of the *base*
  family `(𝒫, Y_𝒫)` and not of the refined `(𝒫, Y''_𝒫)`, so `hbridgeP` below does not apply
  to it. No mass clause is carried, for the same reason: the reduction bounds `|s'|` and
  `λ(s', Y')` from below only by the constants `cP` and `cLam`, which it quantifies
  existentially with no sub-polynomial bound on their reciprocals. -/
