# Very not sticky case of Main Lemma 2

In this file we prove [GWZ, Lemma 9.1] (Very not sticky case of Main Lemma 2), together with
the top-level dichotomy that feeds it: the thick/thin case split
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_goalMult` and the exponent
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.casesplitExponent` it carries.

/-! ### Assembling the thick and thin cases -/

/-- **Exponent in Lemma `lem:ml2casesplit`**.

The blueprint value is
`ν_casesplit(β, ζ) = min(⅛ ϱ β τ, ν_thin(β, ζ))`,
where `⅛ ϱ β τ` is the gain supplied by the thick case (blueprint `lem:ml2thick`, Lean
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge`) and `ν_thin` is the exponent of the thin case
(blueprint `def:ml2thinExponent`, Lean `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thinExponent`).

As for `thinExponent` and `nonslabExponent`, the blueprint writes the exponent as a function
of `β` and `ζ` alone, because the parameters `exscal`, `ϱ` (the blueprint's `\exfact`), `τ`,
`τ'`, `η` of Definition `hyp:ml2params` are fixed functions of `β` and `ζ`, chosen before `δ`
and `𝕋`. In Lean they are separate reals, so they appear as explicit arguments. -/

the theorem `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.smallMultiplicityBudget` of
`MainLemma2/VeryNotSticky.lean`, which is a different
statement: that one is the exponent budget the small-multiplicity *leaf* spends, whereas this
one discharges the `smallMultiplicity` *field* of `CaseParams` from the elementary parameter
bounds of `lem:ml2paramsExist`. -/

-- `η` is now the minimum of eight quantities rather than seven, the eighth being the exponent
-- budget of blueprint `plankF`; each of the twelve `CaseParams` fields unfolds that minimum
-- once, and the proof no longer fits in the default budget.
/-- **The parameter hierarchy is satisfiable**.

For every `β > 0` there is a coarse-scale exponent `exscal > 0`, depending on `β` alone, such
that for every `ζ > 0` the remaining parameters `τ`, `τ'`, `ϱ` (the blueprint's `\exfact`) and
`η` of Definition `hyp:ml2params` can be chosen positive and satisfying every budget of that
definition, i.e. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams`. The quantifier order is the one of
`hyp:ml2params`(P1): `exscal` is produced before `ζ` is introduced, which is what blueprint
Lemma `lemmain2vns` requires.

The last conjunct, `η ≤ ν_casesplit / 2`, is an extra clause beyond `CaseParams`: the proof of
blueprint `lemmain2vns` has to absorb a refinement loss `δ^{-η}` into the case-split gain
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.casesplitExponent`, which is possible exactly when `η` is at most a fixed
fraction of that gain. Carrying it costs nothing, because every field of `CaseParams` bounds `η`
from above only, so `η` may always be shrunk further.

The final conjunct, `2η < τ η_{plankF}`, is the exponent budget of blueprint `plankF` — at the
factor `2` of R16-A, which is what the
`⪆ δ^η ↦ δ^{2η}` rendering of GWZ in (C5) (F8) demands of it — and is
the second clause beyond `CaseParams`. It is what makes the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankF` satisfiable, and hence
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` true rather than merely unproved; see that
statement's binder `hplankF`. It is arranged here, and not carried as a field of `CaseParams`,
only because `CaseParams` is declared upstream of the Section 6 plank interface and cannot
mention `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent`; mathematically it belongs with the other
budgets of blueprint `hyp:ml2params`, and it is discharged in the same way, as one more upper
bound on the `η` this proof chooses last. Note that it costs nothing to the existing budgets
for the same reason they cost nothing to each other, and that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent` is positive unconditionally, so this conjunct is
available without assuming `K_F(β)` — which matters, since the consumer
`Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge` fixes `η` before assuming it. -/

/-- **The side data of the case split**.

Everything `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_goalMult` consumes beyond `cfg`, `bd`, `params` and
`β ≤ 1`, collected into one bundle so that arranging it is a statement of its own rather than
four extra conjuncts of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup`. In the blueprint these are
arranged not in `lem:ml2setupexists` but in the paragraph of the proof of `lemmain2vns` that
chooses `δ` small enough; they are named here because that paragraph is otherwise not
represented by a declaration of its own.

Besides the two constants `CP`, `Θ` and the plank-Frostman exponent `ηF`, which are data and
carry no content of their own, three of the seven remaining fields are assumptions the
blueprint makes rather than discharges:
`thick`, whose achievability is the `δ`-independence question recorded in the note at the end
of blueprint subsection `thickCaseSection`; `tangential`, items (a)–(c) of
`lem:ml2tangential`, which the blueprint likewise assumes and lets travel to its consumers;
and `thr` together with `thr_thick`, whose defining property blueprint
`def:ml2aScaleDataThreshold` does not fix.

The thin-case data `tc` is a field rather than a parameter because `caseScale` and
`tangential` both mention it — the seventh clause of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` is stated
against the comparison constant `tc.C`, which exists only once the thin-case data does. That
is the same reason `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale` travels here rather than standing free. -/

  `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated` is a stronger hypothesis at a larger dilation, while
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentable` gets *stronger*, its `nonconcentration` field
  being asserted at that dilation. So the two fields `plankF` and `plankPres` of
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds` must be asserted at one and the same value,
  and neither may quantify it inside the other. It is `δ`-free — Section 6 produces it ahead of
  `ε`, as `Plank.ThickenedRepr.fibreDilation cThk` — and it is realized from
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolumeAt_plankFrostmanExponent`. Unlike `ηF` it needs no

/-! ### Realizing the side data: the pieces that are not assumptions

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` below has to produce every field of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData`. Four of them are *not* content of the construction and
are discharged here, once and for all, so that the remaining obligation is exactly the part
the blueprint leaves open:

* `thr` and `thr_thick` — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonempty_caseSideData` below, from
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_scaleThresholds_of_le_one` and the field `cfg.hδ1`. The same
  lemma also shows that the `CaseScale` a producer has to supply may be read at *any*
  threshold bundle, the bundle carried by `CaseSideData` being replaceable;
* the fields `hηF` and `budget` of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds`, and the
  guarded field `plankF` — `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.thickDensityThresholds_canonical` below, at
  the canonical exponent `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent cfg.β (ϱβτ/8)`, from the
  binder `hplankF` of `exists_setup_caseSideData` together with
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanUsable_of_thick`.
-/

/-- **The two thresholds of blueprint `plankF` under the thick-case guard.**

Blueprint `plankF` is applicable at the scales of the configuration as soon as its parameters
`(ηF, b₀)` fit them: that is the predicate
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable`, whose two thresholds read
`CP δ/a ≤ b₀` and `CP (CP δ/b)^{ηF} ≤ c₁ δ^{2η}`. Both mention the working scales `a`, `b` of the
factoring, which Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` constrains only by `δ ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r₁`, so neither
is a threshold on `δ` alone.

Under the thick-case guard `δ^{1-τ} ≤ a` they become ones, and this lemma is that reduction:
since `δ = δ^τ δ^{1-τ} ≤ δ^τ a` and, `a ≤ b` being the field
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.hdims`, also `δ ≤ δ^τ b`, the two ratios satisfy `δ/a ≤ δ^τ` and
`δ/b ≤ δ^τ`, and the thresholds follow from
`CP δ^τ ≤ b₀` and `CP^{1+ηF} δ^{τ ηF - 2η} ≤ c₁`.

This is the computation the docstrings of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanUsable` and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.plankF` record as the reason the field is
satisfiable: the second hypothesis is met for `δ` small exactly when the exponent
`τ ηF - 2η` is positive, i.e. `2η < τ ηF` — which is the budget of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds.budget` and of the target's binder
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanBudget` since R16-A, the factor `2` matching F8 , which reads
(C5) at `δ^{2η}`. With it `hc₁` is met for `δ` small by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_plankFrostman_thresholds` read at `η := 2 cfg.η`; it stays a
binder here so that the lemma is stated at one fixed `δ`. -/

/-- **The `δ`-free half of blueprint `plankF`, at the canonical exponent.**

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolume` derives blueprint `plankF` from `K_F(β)`, and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanVolumeAt_plankFrostmanExponent` moves it to the named
exponent `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent β ε`. Composing them is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` must do **before** it fixes `δ`: the
non-concentration dilation `C_NC` and the parameter `b₀` produced here are functions of `β`
and `ε` alone, so the two thresholds of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanUsable_of_thick` are genuine smallness conditions on `δ`.

Recording the composition separately is what keeps that quantifier order visible; see the
docstring of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent` for why the exponent may not be
existentially bound here. -/

Three of the eight fields of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds` are discharged
here, at the exponent `ηF = Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent cfg.β (ϱβτ/8)` at
which `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` instantiates the structure:

* `hηF` and `budget`, `0 < ηF` and `2η < τ ηF`, are two of the three conjuncts of the binder
  `hplankF` of that statement, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanBudget`, arranged ahead of
  `δ` by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams`;
* `plankF` is `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanUsable_of_thick`, whose guard is the one the
  field already carries, from the `δ`-free plank estimate `hvol` (supplied by
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_plankFrostmanVolumeAt_canonical`) and the two fixed-scale
  thresholds `hb₀`, `hc₁`. Since F8  `hc₁` reads
  `CP^{1+ηF} δ^{τ ηF - 2η} ≤ c₁`, which `hbudget : 2η < τ ηF`
  supplies for small `δ` through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_plankFrostman_thresholds`
  read at `η := 2 cfg.η`; it is a binder here because the lemma is stated at one fixed `δ`.

What is left is `bias`, `plankPres` and `density`, the three the blueprint assumes rather than
discharges, plus the two constant normalizations `hCP` and `hΘ`. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_scaleThresholds_of_le_one` exposes only the defining inequality
of `aScale`, which is all the thick chain spends. `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` reads two
of the three thresholds — `aScaleData_threshold` at `aScale ν` and `typicalAngle_threshold` at
`typical` — so a producer of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData`, which has to assert the
`CaseScale` and the bundle it carries at one and the same `thr`, needs both at once. This is
that strengthening, at the same trivial witness: all three thresholds equal to `1`, absorbing
the constant `1`, for which `aScale_absorb` reads `1 ≤ δ^{-η}` and holds because `0 < δ ≤ 1`
and `η > 0`. The third inequality, at `fill`, is carried too, so that the statement covers
every field of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds` rather than the two in use today. -/

/-- **The side data of the case split, from the five bundles that carry its content.**

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData` has eleven fields, of which four are data (`CP`, `Θ`,
`ηF`, `C_NC`) and seven carry content. This lemma discharges two of the seven, `thr` and
`thr_thick`, from the field `cfg.hδ1` alone, by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_scaleThresholds_of_le_one`: the threshold bundle carries no
defining property that ties it to the configuration, so the trivial bundle — all thresholds
`1`, absorbing the constant `1` — serves, and `cfg.δ ≤ 1` discharges the eighth clause of
Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` at *every* gain, in particular at the thick gain `ϱβτ/8` of
`thr_thick`.

It also decouples the `CaseScale` from the bundle. In `CaseSideData` the two are asserted
against one and the same `thr`, but `thr` occurs in `CaseScale` only through the single clause
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.aScaleData_threshold`, so a `CaseScale` at *any* threshold
bundle `thr₀` suffices: the clause is re-proved at the bundle produced here. A producer of the
side data therefore never has to match its threshold bundle to anyone else's.

What remains — `thick`, `tc`, `slabScale`, `caseScale` and `tangential` — is the genuine
content of blueprint `lem:ml2setupSideData`, three items of which the blueprint assumes rather
than discharges; see the docstring of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData`. -/

`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.gridFine`).

`1 ≤ η ⌈log log 1/δ⌉` for all sufficiently small `δ`, for every fixed `η > 0`. This is the one
field of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky` that is a condition on `δ` alone, involving no constant
produced after `δ`, and it is therefore discharged here rather than assumed: the grid length
`Tube.ssfGridLen δ = ⌈log log 1/δ⌉` tends to infinity as `δ → 0⁺`, because
`1/δ → ∞` and `log` tends to infinity along `atTop`, so `ssfGridLen δ` eventually exceeds
`1/η`.

This is the statement the docstring of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.gridFine` attributes to
`Kakeya.StickyKakeya.exists_ssfGridLen_threshold`: sub-polynomiality of the grid step is the
design intent of the grid length `log log 1/δ`. It is proved directly from
`Nat.le_ceil` and the two `atTop` limits, so it depends on nothing but the definition of the
grid length. -/

/-- **The typical-angle multiplicity threshold is eventually met** (the fourth clause of
Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`, `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.multiplicity_large`).

`2 ≤ (δ/r₁)^{-η}` at `r₁ = δ^{exscal}`, for all sufficiently small `δ`. Like
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.eventually_gridFine` this is a condition on `δ` and the exponent
parameters alone — it mentions neither `bd.C₀` nor `bd.Cbias` nor the thin-case comparison
constant, the three quantities the construction produces only after `δ` — so it is discharged
here rather than assumed. Indeed `δ/r₁ = δ^{1-exscal}`, so the left-hand side is
`δ^{-(1-exscal)η}` and the exponent `(1-exscal)η` is positive and fixed before `δ`.

It is the only one of the thirteen clauses of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` with that
property; the other twelve all mention a constant produced after `δ`, and are therefore
arrangeable only alongside the construction of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData`. -/

/-- **The exponent budget of blueprint `plankF`, at a free plank-Frostman exponent.**

`2η < τ ηF` for *some* exponent `ηF > 0` at which the plank-Frostman volume estimate
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.PlankFrostmanVolumeAt` holds, together with the two constants
`b₀`, `C_NC` that estimate carries.

**The factor `2` accounts for the fullness loss**. GWZ's thick case applies Lemma 6.4 (GWZ) to planks of short
side `δ/b ≤ δ/a ≤ δ^τ` at fullness `λ(P, Y_P) ⪆ δ^η`; under the
`⪆` convention (every-`ε` slack) that is the budget `η < τ η_{6.4}`, with
`η = η(β, ζ)` chosen after `τ` and `η_{6.4}`. This development renders every
`⪆ δ^η` on the path as `δ^{2η}` with a `δ`-free constant — since F8  also the per-segment density (C5), `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData.segs_density` —
so the second threshold of `plankF` reads `CP^{1+ηF} δ^{τ ηF - 2η} ≤ c₁` and the budget
stated against that rendering is `2η < τ ηF`. This is a *strengthening* of the hypothesis
(fewer admissible parameter tuples), i.e. a change of meaning of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` and of
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SideDataResidue` with their texts unchanged; Lemma 9.1
(`Kakeya.multiplicity_le_of_card_isEssDistinct_ge`) is unchanged in text and meaning and
re-closes from `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_caseParams` at `η ≤ τ η_{plankF}/4`.

This is the honest form of the binder that
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_setup_caseSideData` used to state as
`η < τ * Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanExponent β (ϱβτ/8)`.  That form named a
`Classical.choose` witness in a *statement*, which is a fidelity defect twice over: nothing in
the development bounds the chosen value from below, so the hypothesis is neither checkable nor
transportable; and the bundle the statement produces —
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds`, whose fields `hηF`, `budget` and `plankF` are
exactly the three conjuncts here — takes its exponent **free** already, so nothing downstream
ever wanted the canonical one.

It is a **weaker hypothesis** than the canonical-exponent form at the same factor, hence a
*strengthening* of every statement that assumes it:
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankFrostmanBudget_of_lt` derives it from
`2η < τ · plankFrostmanExponent β (ϱβτ/8)` and the Frostman estimate, which every consumer
has in scope.  Nothing is deferred: the data this
existential carries is precisely the data the old form recovered by calling
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_plankFrostmanVolumeAt_canonical`. -/

/-- **Main Lemma 2, very not sticky case: assembling the cases**.

Let `cfg` realize Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`, let `params` satisfy the explicit budgets of
Definition `hyp:ml2params`, and let `scale` satisfy Configuration `hyp:ml2scale`. Then the
goal `eqgoalmuT` holds with the gain
`ν = Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.casesplitExponent cfg.β cfg.ζ cfg.exscal τ τ' cfg.ϱ`, which is
positive by `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.casesplitExponent_pos`.

The convex bodies `W ∈ 𝕎_B` have smallest affine thickness `τ₂(W) ∼ a`, and `a` does not
depend on `B` by (C4), so `le_total (cfg.δ ^ (1 - τ)) cfg.a` splits the proof into two
branches. If `δ^{1-τ} ≤ a` we are in the thick case and
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge` gives the goal with exponent `ϱ β τ / 8`. If
`a ≤ δ^{1-τ}` we are in the thin case and `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le` gives it with exponent
`thinExponent cfg.β cfg.ζ cfg.exscal τ'`. In either case the exponent is at least `ν`, and
since `0 < δ ≤ 1` the map `s ↦ δ^s` is antitone
(`ENNReal.rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge`), so the estimate with the larger exponent implies the
estimate with `ν`.

The field `cfg.hδ1` records `δ ≤ 1`, which makes `s ↦ δ^s` antitone.

The eleven fixed-scale smallness hypotheses in `δ` of Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` are
packaged as `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale` and threaded through the thin branch. The first
ensures that the dilated angular scale `ρ₂*` is at most one; the next three are consumed
inside `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_isTypicalAnglePlank`; the fifth,
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseScale.transverse_radius`, is the transverse transfer-radius
threshold `6 C_{w₁}(C₀) ≤ δ^{-τ'}` consumed by
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`; the seventh is what
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.transverseBallFill` spends on its constant; and the eighth, ninth,
tenth and eleventh are the by-choice thresholds bundled as
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ScaleThresholds`, threaded from here to the leaves that will consume
them. They hold once `δ` is sufficiently small, with `bd.C₀`, `bd.Cbias`, `tc.C`, the gain and
the exponents fixed first, as required by the eventual top-level theorem.

This lemma is where Configuration `hyp:ml2scale` is *arranged*, and two of its clauses — the
seventh and the tenth — have left-hand sides produced after `δ`. The seventh mentions the
comparison constant `tc.C` of Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`, which exists only once the
thin-case data does, so the bundle cannot be a free-standing hypothesis: like
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale`, it travels inside `hslabScale`, the packaged form *there is
a thin configuration whose comparison constant satisfies the thresholds*. Packaging the thin
configuration together with both bundles is what makes the constant available, and it is why
this lemma consumes the thin data from `hslabScale` rather than calling
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_thinConfig` itself; that lemma is what produces such a bundle,
and hence what will discharge `hslabScale` once `δ` is taken small in terms of the constant it
returns. Note that `exists_thinConfig` does not use the thin-case hypothesis `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`, so
`hslabScale` is stated unconditionally.

**Both instances of the eighth clause are carried,** at the two gains by which blueprint
`lem:ml2casesplit` indexes it, and against the one shared `thr`. The `CaseScale` inside
`hslabScale` is read at the transverse gain `ν = τ'β/2`, the gain at which the thin chain
invokes `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_aScaleData` through
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_theta_ge`; the separate `hthrThick` is the same clause at
the thick gain `ν_{lem:ml2thick} = ϱβτ/8`, which the thick branch needs because
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge` reduces to
`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge_of_goalDensity`, and that in turn applies
`exists_aScaleData` at the thick gain.

The thick instance is a bare inequality rather than a second `CaseScale`, matching the binder
of blueprint `lem:ml2thickFromDens`: the clause mentions only `δ`, the gain and data fixed
before `δ`, whereas `CaseScale` also mentions `bd` and the thin-case constant `tc.C`, neither
of which the thick chain sees. Both gains are functions of `β` and `ζ` alone and are fixed
before `δ`, so, as the blueprint proof of `lem:ml2casesplit` records, taking the smaller of
the two thresholds arranges both at once; this lemma is where that is assumed, and no
declaration below it carries a fixed-scale threshold of its own.

Further hypotheses beyond Configuration `hyp:ml2setup` are needed and are therefore
explicit.

* `hβ1 : cfg.β ≤ 1`, which is hypothesis (T1) of blueprint `lem:ml2thick` and is consumed by
  the thick branch through `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_a_ge` and by the non-slab leaves
  of the thin branch, through `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`, where the Katz–Tao bound
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.nonslabKKT` needs it. It is not implied by
  `cfg.hβ`, which only gives `0 < β`, and `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseParams` carries no such
  budget; blueprint `hyp:ml2params` records that omission. It is threaded here rather than
  discharged, which is the first of the two remedies discussed in the note at the end of
  blueprint subsection `thickCaseSection`.
* `hdens : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickDensityThresholds cfg bd τ`, hypotheses (T3) and (T6) of
  blueprint `lem:ml2thick`: the two scale thresholds of blueprint `thickDensityThresholds`,
  the second in the form quantified over the constants that
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.exists_denseInBody` produces and guarded by the thick-case
  hypothesis `δ^{1-τ} ≤ a` of `lem:ml2thickDensity`, which this proof supplies from the
  branch of its dichotomy where it holds. They are threaded by the same remedy
  and for the same reason as `hβ1`, and are named rather than written out because they occur
  verbatim as a field of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.CaseSideData` as well; see that
  structure.
* the third conjunct of `hslabScale`, `Nonempty (TangentialInputs cfg tc τ')`, which is items
  (a)–(c) of blueprint `lem:ml2tangential`. It travels inside `hslabScale` rather than as a
  free hypothesis because it mentions the thin-case data `tc`, exactly as
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.SlabScale` and the seventh clause of `hyp:ml2scale` do; from here it
  is threaded through `Kakeya.goalMult_of_a_le`,
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_b_le` and
  `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.goalMult_of_multBodies_ge` to the tangential leaf.
* `bd`: the thin branch needs Configuration `hyp:ml2thinsetup`. As the blueprint proof
  stresses, that is *not* an extra assumption on `(𝕋, Y)` — it is extra data attached to the
  very same pair, and `lem:ml2thinsetupexists` produces it from Configuration `hyp:ml2setup`
  and `a ≤ δ^{1-τ}`. So this lemma takes only the `cfg`-relative per-ball data
  `bd : Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.BallData cfg` of `hyp:ml2setup`, and obtains the thin-case bundle
  from `hslabScale`, packaged with its fixed-scale thresholds as explained above. No refinement
  of `(𝕋, Y)` is taken here: the pair fed to the thin case is the one already recorded by
  `cfg`. -/
