# The anchor/carrier prism API for the active thickened family

Each active index `t` of the thickened representative family of GWZ Lemma 6.13 carries **two**
prisms rather than one.

* The **anchor** `Qanchor t` is the *undilated* thickened representative of
  `Plank.ThickenedRepr`.  It is the scale at which `repr`, the pairwise essential distinctness of
  the active family, the representative fibres, the common fibre size `N` and all counting live.
* The **carrier** `Qcarrier t` is a *fixed dilation* of the anchor.  It is the scale at which the
  thickened shading's carrier, Item 2's fullness, the dense-box/dense-ball shading support and the
  thickened carrier volume live.

The two are tied by the two **directed** containments
`(Qanchor t).carrier ⊆ (Qcarrier t).carrier` and
`(Qcarrier t).carrier ⊆ ((Qanchor t).dilation Ccarrier).carrier`, with `Ccarrier ≥ 1` uniform and
quantified before the configuration.  A disjunction (`PrismNDim.IsCComparable`) would not do: it
leaves open which of the two containments holds and so supplies control in neither direction.

**Pairwise essential distinctness is asserted for the anchor only.**  A fixed dilation does *not*
preserve essential distinctness, so the carrier family is not, and must never be assumed to be,
pairwise essentially distinct.  This is exactly why the split exists: without it the interface has
to pick one scale and pay a dilation where it does not belong.

The shading-support clause `Plank.ThickenedAnchorCarrierData.shade_subset_carrier` is a **field**,
not something to be reconstructed at the point of use: the shading of a plank is only known to sit
in the plank, and the plank only in a *dilation* of its representative, so the containment in the
carrier holds precisely because the carrier is that dilation.  Requiring `Ccarrier` to dominate the
representative-comparability constant `cThk` is what makes the field available.

`Plank.exists_thickenedAnchorCarrierData` builds the data from the clauses that
`Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform` returns.  The exact anchor volume `8θb²` is
`Plank.volume_indexSet_eq`, and `Plank.ratio_mul_plankVolume_ennreal` puts it in the shape the
symbolic Item 4 reduction's `hcarrierVolume` hypothesis asks for.

/-- **The anchor/carrier data of an active thickened family.**  One index type `τ` carrying two
prism maps: the undilated `anchor`, which owns `repr`, essential distinctness and all fibre
counting, and the `carrier`, a fixed `Ccarrier`-dilation of the anchor, which owns the shading
support and all carrier volumes.  See the module docstring for why the split is necessary and why
`anchor_pairwise` is stated for the anchor only. -/

/-- **Construction of the anchor/carrier data from the clauses of the witness.**  The anchor is the
prism map `Qanchor` that the witness returns (the undilated thickened representative), and the
carrier is its fixed `Ccarrier`-dilation, so `carrier_subset_dilation` holds by reflexivity and
`anchor_subset_carrier` is `PrismNDim.self_subset_dilation`.

The shading hypothesis `hshade` is stated at the *dilated* scale, which is what the witness has:
a shading sits in its plank, and a plank in the `cThk`-dilation of its representative, so it is
enough that `Ccarrier` dominate `cThk`.

The conclusion pins down all four components, so the data is not merely some anchor/carrier package
but the one built on the witness's own `repr`, active set and prisms. -/

/-! ### The anchor volume of a thickened representative -/

/-- The anchor of an active index is the undilated `θb × b × 1` thickening of the selected plank, so
its volume is exactly `8θb²`.  Composed with `measure_mono` along
`PrismNDim.self_subset_dilation`, this supplies the carrier-volume lower bound of the symbolic
Item 4 reduction; `Plank.ratio_mul_plankVolume_ennreal` puts it in the `ratio · volP` shape that
hypothesis asks for. -/

`θb/a` applied to the plank volume `8ab` returns the thickened volume `8θb²`.  Needs `a ≠ 0`, since
the ratio is a division. -/

carrier volume is at least `8θb²`. -/
