# The assigned slab family

`Plank.sharedSlabThickenedShadingDilation` shades a representative prism `Q` by the union of the
shadings of *all* planks of `s'` whose representative is assigned the same slab as `Q`, i.e. by the
finite set `s'.filter (fun i => slabOf (repr i) = slabOf Q)`.  That set is the object the whole
slab-local analysis of GWZ Lemma 6.13 runs on, and this file gives it a name,
`Plank.assignedSlabFamily`, together with the partition API it satisfies.

The point of naming it is that it is *exact*: the assigned families are pairwise disjoint and cover
`s'`, so a sum of slab-local mass bounds over the used slabs telescopes into a global bound with no
overlap loss at all.  This is what distinguishes it from `Plank.inSlabFamilyC`, which is a
*geometric* family — every plank comparable with the slab, whether or not it was assigned to it —
and which genuinely overlaps between slabs, so that summing over it costs the slab overlap constant
`Nov`.  The two are used for different purposes and must not be confused: `inSlabFamilyC` supplies
containment and angle information, `assignedSlabFamily` supplies the partition.

Nothing here is deep; the content is that the shading actually used by the public statement of
Lemma 6.13 is definitionally the assigned-family shading
(`Plank.sharedSlabThickenedShadingDilation_shade_assigned`), so the partition lemmas apply to it
verbatim.

/-- **The assigned slab family**: the planks of `s'` whose representative was assigned the slab
index `S`.

This is the exact fibre of `slabOf ∘ repr` over `S`, not the geometric family
`Plank.inSlabFamilyC`.  It is the family the shared thickened shading is built from.

The representative type `τ` is arbitrary: this family is pure `Finset` combinatorics and never
inspects the geometry of a representative, so Lemma 6.13 can instantiate it at the typed
`Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b hθ1 hb1` without erasing to `EnsemblePrism`. -/

/-! ## The two halves of the bounded-overlap bound

These are pure index combinatorics about a finite family of index sets, stated here because the
slab-local fullness layer and the good-box layer
(`Plank.sum_volume_sdiff_goodBoxUnionLocal_le_of_trimmed`) need them, and the latter sits upstream
of `Kakeya.plankReduction`.

They are what replaces the exact `Plank.assignedSlabFamily` partition when the families in play are
the *geometric* `Plank.inSlabFamilyC` ones, which genuinely overlap — but only `Nov`-fold,
with `Nov` uniform (`Plank.slab_index_overlap_le`).

If every family `Fam S` sits inside `s` and every index of `s` lies in at most `Nov` of them, then
`∑_{S ∈ 𝒮} |Fam S| ≤ Nov · |s|`.  This is the double count that replaces the
configuration-dependent
`|𝒮|` in the slab-local fullness layer. -/

/-! ## Slab-complete restriction: the representative bookkeeping

The Item 2 route is allowed to delete *slabs*, through the good-slab prune of
`Plank.exists_dominantGoodSlabRefinement`, but it is not allowed to delete *representatives*: the
common fibre size `N` of the preassembly must survive without a new pigeonhole step, and the
two-sided fibre bounds `N / cN ≤ #rep⁻¹(Q) ≤ cN N` must be reusable verbatim on the restricted
family.

Slab-complete deletion is exactly what makes that work, and this section records why, in three
purely combinatorial identities.  Nothing here mentions geometry, measure, or the scale `a`;
they are `Finset` identities about the fibres of `slabOf ∘ repr`, deliberately kept apart from
the geometric
layers.

The two that carry the content are:

* `Plank.filter_repr_assignedSlabFamily_eq` — a representative's fibre inside the assigned family of
  its own slab is its *whole* fibre.  This is what preserves the fibre-size bounds.
* `Plank.assignedSlabFamily_filter_slab_mem` — restricting the index set to a set of retained slabs
  does not change the assigned family of any retained slab.  This is what "slab-complete" means.

Together they say: after a slab-complete restriction, a surviving representative sees exactly the
same fibre it saw before, so no bound about it has to be re-derived.
-/

/-! ### Representative fibres inside the assigned family -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **A representative's fibre is not cut by passing to its own slab's assigned family.**  If
`slabOf Q = S`, then every index with representative `Q` is by definition assigned to `S`, so
intersecting with the assigned family of `S` removes nothing.

This is the identity that lets the preassembly's two-sided fibre bounds
`N / cN ≤ #rep⁻¹(Q) ≤ cN N` be reused verbatim on the assigned family — no new pigeonhole, and in
particular no representative-cardinality retention factor. -/
theorem filter_repr_assignedSlabFamily_eq (s' : Finset ι) (repr : ι → τ) (slabOf : τ → σ)
    (S : σ) {Q : τ} (hQ : slabOf Q = S) :
    (assignedSlabFamily s' repr slabOf S).filter (fun i => repr i = Q)
      = s'.filter (fun i => repr i = Q) := by
  ext i
  simp only [Finset.mem_filter, mem_assignedSlabFamily]
  exact ⟨fun h => ⟨h.1.1, h.2⟩, fun h => ⟨⟨h.1, h.2 ▸ hQ⟩, h.2⟩⟩

open scoped Classical in
/-- **The assigned family's representatives are exactly the canonical slab fibre.**  Taking the
`repr`-image of the assigned family of `S` gives precisely the members of the active family lying
over `S`.

This is the identity that identifies the *output* family of the C-linear route, run on the assigned
family, with the canonical public fibre `R.indexSet.filter (fun Q => slabOf Q = S)`.  Note it is an
identity of *representative* families, not of index families: no comparison between
`Plank.inSlabFamilyC` and `Plank.assignedSlabFamily` is involved. -/

    (assignedSlabFamily s' repr slabOf S).image repr
      = (s'.image repr).filter (fun Q => slabOf Q = S) := by
  rw [assignedSlabFamily, Finset.filter_image]

/-! ### Slab-complete restriction of the index set -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **Slab-complete restriction does not change a retained slab's assigned family.**  Deleting the
indices whose slab was rejected leaves the assigned family of every *retained* slab untouched.

This is the precise sense in which the good-slab prune is slab-complete: if a slab survives, its
whole assigned family survives, hence every surviving representative keeps its entire fibre.  It is
what separates this permitted deletion from representative-level pruning. -/
