# From the geometric slab family to the assigned slab family, via dominant regions

Item 2 of GWZ Lemma 6.13 runs on two different index families and *must* keep them apart.

* The **geometric** family `Plank.inSlabFamilyC Cset Cang s' V S` — every plank comparable with the
  slab `S` — is what the local angular arguments need, because it is shade-fibre closed after the
  constant inflation of `Plank.shadeFibre_trimmed_inSlabFamilyC_eq`.  The assigned family is *not*
  fibre closed, and a pigeonhole over the slabs cannot make it so uniformly: the slab realising a
  fibre-retention bound moves with the point.
* The **assigned** family `Plank.assignedSlabFamily s' repr slabOf S` — the exact fibre of
  `slabOf ∘ repr` — is what the public statement must use, because it is a genuine partition of `s'`
  and it is induced by the canonical `slabOf`.

The two are not equal, and the useful inclusion runs the wrong way:
`assignedSlabFamily S ⊆ inSlabFamilyC Cset Cang s' V S`
(`Plank.assignedSlabFamily_subset_inSlabFamilyC`), so a *lower* bound on the geometric family's
shading mass says nothing about the assigned family's.

This file supplies the missing link, and it is not a comparison of index families at all — it is a
statement about *points*.  On the dominant region of `S` the assigned family carries a
`Nov⁻¹`-fraction of the whole pointwise multiplicity, and a shaded point of the assigned family
always lies in that region (`Plank.mem_dominantSlabRegion_of_mem_biUnion_assigned`), because the
dominant shading cuts each plank against the dominant region of *its own* assigned slab.  Combining
the two gives a fibre retention that *is* uniform in the point at a fixed slab, which is exactly
what the two-sided angular predicates need.

Because everything here is at the level of points and fibre cardinalities, it costs **no** power of
`a`; the entire price of the passage is the absolute `Nov` already inside the definition of the
dominant region, and `Plank.dominantGoodSlab_assigned_fibre_retention_source` spends it
exactly once.

/-! ## The uniform-in-`x` fibre retention of a fixed slab

The retention is stated against the *uncut* source shading `Y'`, so the passage from the
preassembly family to a retained assigned slab costs exactly one factor of `Nov`. -/

/-- **A shaded point of the assigned family lies in that slab's dominant region.**  Immediate from
the definition of `Plank.dominantSlabShading`, which cuts each plank against the dominant region of
*its own* assigned slab: for `i` assigned to `S` that region is the one of `S`. -/

/-- **The assigned fibre of the dominant shading retains a `Nov⁻¹`-fraction of the fibre of the
original shading `Y'`.**

The dominant-region condition compares the *whole* `(s', Y')` fibre with the assigned `(𝒜 S, Y')`
fibre, and on the dominant region the latter coincides with the assigned fibre of the dominant
shading.  The bound is uniform in `x` and holds for a **fixed** slab `S`, which is what the
two-sided angular predicates need: after cutting every plank against the dominant region of its own
slab, a point of the assigned family's shading union is *by construction* a point where that slab
dominates.  No power of `a` is spent.

Stating it against `(s', Y')` matters because the passage `(s', Y') → (𝒜 S, Ydom)` then costs a
single factor `Nov`; routing through `(s₁, Ydom)` and transporting a second time would charge `Nov`
twice and demand a reserve stability scale of order `Nov ^ 2`. -/

/-- **The one-`Nov` fibre retention from the preassembly family to a retained assigned slab.**

The source is the preassembly's own `(s', Y')`, so this is exactly the retention hypothesis of
`Plank.isTypicalPlankAngle_of_fibreRetention` at `q = Nov⁻¹` with the preassembly's *reserve* scale
`Nov · A` as the source scale — one factor of `Nov`, no power of `a`, and no `a₀`. -/

/-! ## The stop-scale stability clause on the assigned dominant family -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **The stop-scale stability clause transports from the preassembly source to a retained assigned
dominant family, at the cost of exactly one factor of `Nov`.**

The source clause lives on `(s', Y')` at the reserve scale `Nov · Aout`; the target lives on the
assigned dominant family of a retained slab at the bare scale `Aout`.  The transport is
`Plank.dominantGoodSlab_assigned_fibre_retention_source`, which is the *direct* `s' → 𝒜 S`
retention: routing through the global `(s₁, Ydom)` instead would spend `Nov` twice and demand a
reserve of order `Nov ^ 2 · Aout`, which the preassembly does not supply and which no `a`-free
constant can repair.

The angular constant `K · Kakeya.plankAngleScaleB a` is carried through untouched; the conclusion is
stated in the quotient form that `Plank.localAngleConcentration_of_saturated_scaled` consumes. -/
