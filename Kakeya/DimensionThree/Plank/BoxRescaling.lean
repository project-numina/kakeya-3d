# Lean-facing geometric API for GWZ Lemma 6.13 — affine rescaling
The box-rescaling layer of the plank geometry.

The companion file `Kakeya.DimensionThree.Plank.SlabIntersection` holds the outer slab model and
slab-angle half. This file contains the homothety image lemma for prisms
(`homothety_image_prism_carrier_of_center`) together with the measurability and volume-scaling of
homothety images (`measurableSet_homothety_image`, `volume_iUnion_homothety_image`,
`volume_inter_homothety_image`), which is what the dense-box slab construction consumes.

/-- **General-centre homothety image of a prism** (helper for the dense-box slab construction):
a homothety by ratio `r > 0` about an *arbitrary* centre `c` maps a prism's carrier onto the prism
with the same axes, thicknesses scaled by `r`, and centre the image `homothety c r P.center` of the
old centre. This generalises `homothety_image_prism_carrier` (the case `c = P.center`) so that the
box-normalising map `boxRescaleAffine` (a homothety about `Q.center`) can be applied to an outer
slab model `plankSlabModel P x₀` centred at a point `x₀ ≠ Q.center`. -/

Jacobian `|r|³` (dimension `3`), and commutes with unions, so the image of `⋃ i∈s, g i` has volume
`ofReal |r|³` times that of `⋃ i∈s, g i`. This is the identity used to pull the rescaled
