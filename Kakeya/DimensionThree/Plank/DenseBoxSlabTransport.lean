# Dense `θb`-ball capture, and the bridge from the per-box dense-box estimate

This file joins the two halves of the paper's local route for item 1 of GWZ Lemma 6.13.

The first half is already proved, but only as an anonymous intermediate step: inside
`Plank.perRepresentativeDensity_saturated_dilated` there is a `have` establishing, for a single
shifted grid box `B_q`, the equation-(37) estimate

`cDense · cLam · a ^ (2η) · lam · |B_q| ≤ |U ∩ B_q|`,

a lower bound on the *union* inside the box.  `Plank.denseBoxUnionEstimate_shiftedBox` below states
it as a public lemma.  This is the estimate that makes item 1 work at all: it is obtained by
Cauchy–Schwarz against the angular-concentration hypothesis, i.e. by controlling the `L²` norm of
the multiplicity function, and it therefore needs no upper bound on the multiplicity — which the
hypotheses of Lemma 6.13 do not provide.

The second half is `Plank.denseBallUnionCapture_of_denseBox`.  A shifted grid box is a genuine
`Plank.ThetaBox θ b`, so its `θb`-ball grid has total volume at most `729 · |B_q|` with an absolute
constant, and the non-dense balls can be charged against `|B_q|` rather than against a sum of
shading masses.

`Plank.denseBallCapture_of_denseBoxEstimate` composes them at the ball threshold `cThr · lowQ`,
where `cThr = (2 · Cball)⁻¹` is absolute and is fixed before the box and the configuration.  It is
the form item 1 consumes: every point of the retained local union lies in a `θb`-ball that is dense
for the retained set itself, which is exactly the `hcover` hypothesis of
`Plank.denseBall_arbitraryCentre_fullness`.  Only `lowQ` carries configuration dependence and it
enters linearly, so a dense-box estimate at `lowQ = cBox · a ^ E` gives a ball density at
`cThr · cBox · a ^ E` with no further loss.

/-! ## Dense `θb`-ball capture inside a single dense box

This section carries the local half of item 1 of GWZ Lemma 6.13, and it is the step that makes the
whole item work without any upper bound on the multiplicity.

The global "delete the sparse `θb`-balls" argument fails: its cost is `t · B_tot`, where `B_tot` is
the total volume of a `θb`-ball cover of the *whole* shading union, and nothing in the hypotheses of
Lemma 6.13 compares `B_tot` with `|U|` — doing so amounts to an upper bound on the average
multiplicity, which the hypotheses bound only from below.

Run inside one box, the same argument costs nothing extra.  `Plank.thetaBallGrid_sum_volume_le`
bounds the total grid volume by `729 · |Q|` with an **absolute** constant, and the dense-box
estimate `Plank.denseBoxEstimate_boxNormalised_combined` bounds the local union from below
by `lowQ · |Q|` (this is equation (37) of the paper; note it is a genuine *union* bound, obtained by
Cauchy–Schwarz against the angular-concentration hypothesis, not a sum-of-shades bound).  So the
deleted mass is at most `t · 729 · |Q| ≤ (729 t / lowQ) · |U_Q|`, and choosing `t` a fixed fraction
of `lowQ / 729` retains half of `|U_Q|`.  The retention constant is the absolute `1/2`; the whole
configuration dependence sits in `lowQ`, where the paper puts it.

`Plank.denseBallUnionCapture_of_denseBox` packages this.  Its last conclusion is stated for the
*retained* set `UQ ∩ GQ` rather than for `UQ`, which is what
`Plank.denseBall_arbitraryCentre_fullness` consumes: a dense ball is contained in `GQ`, so cutting
`UQ` down to `UQ ∩ GQ` does not change its intersection with that ball.
-/

/-- **Dense `θb`-balls inside a dense box capture half of the local union.**

`UQ` is any measurable subset of the box `Q` (the intended instance is the local shading union of
the planks assigned to the slab, restricted to `Q`), and `Cball` bounds the total grid volume by
`Cball · |Q|` (`Plank.thetaBallGrid_sum_volume_le`, with the absolute value `729`).

Provided the ball threshold `t` satisfies `2 · t · Cball · |Q| ≤ |UQ|` — which is exactly what the
dense-box estimate `lowQ · |Q| ≤ |UQ|` supplies once `t := lowQ / (2 · Cball)` — the union `GQ` of
the dense grid
balls retains half of `UQ`, and every point of `GQ` lies in a grid ball that is dense *for the
retained set* `UQ ∩ GQ`.

The density clause is quantified over `GQ`, not over `UQ ∩ GQ`.  That matters downstream: when the
local sets are aggregated over many boxes and slabs, a point of the global retained shading may lie
in the `GQ` of a box whose own local union it does not belong to, and it still has to be handed a
dense ball.  Nothing is lost, because the proof only ever uses that `y` lies in some dense grid
ball.

The retention constant is the absolute `1/2`: no power of `a` and no configuration datum enters it.
The non-dense balls are charged against `|Q|`, never against a sum of shading masses, which is
exactly what keeps the estimate free of any multiplicity hypothesis. -/

/-- **Dense `θb`-balls from a dense-box estimate.**

`Plank.denseBallUnionCapture_of_denseBox` run at the grid-volume constant of
`Plank.thetaBallGrid_sum_volume_le` and at the ball threshold `cThr · lowQ`, where
`cThr = (2 · Cball)⁻¹` is absolute and is fixed **before** the box and the configuration.  The
hypothesis `2 · t · Cball · |Q| ≤ |U ∩ Q|` of that theorem is then exactly the dense-box estimate
`lowQ · |Q| ≤ |U ∩ Q|`.

The last clause is the `hcover` input of `Plank.denseBall_arbitraryCentre_fullness` for the local
union: the density is stated for the *retained* set, and the retention constant is the absolute
`1/2`.  Only `lowQ` carries configuration dependence, and it enters the ball threshold linearly —
so a dense-box estimate at `lowQ = cBox · a ^ E` yields a ball density at `cThr · cBox · a ^ E`,
with no further loss. -/
