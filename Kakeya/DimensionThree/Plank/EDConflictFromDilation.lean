# What the essentially-distinct plank extraction actually consumes: one dilation count

`Kakeya.exists_pairwise_plank_subset_of_isThickeningNonconcentrated`
(`Kakeya/Factoring/FlatPrisms.lean`) is stated over `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated`, a clause
quantified over **every** `φ ∈ [a/b, 1]`.  Its proof uses that clause at exactly one place and
exactly one value — `hNC i hi (a / b) hab1 le_rfl` — and the docstring says so: *"the point is to
test at the smallest admissible thickening `a / b`; at that scale the thickened plank is the
original plank."*

That matters for GWZ 6.6(B), because the `φ > a/b` range of the clause is **not** a volume-ratio
statement: the container there is `Λφb × Λb × Λ`, the volume ratio is `α = a / (Λ³ φ b)`, and the
bound the clause asks for is `M · φ`, i.e. *linear* in `1/α`, whereas the general convex packing
count `Kakeya.cardEssDistinctConvexInPrismConstant 3 α` is `2 ^ Θ(α⁻³)`.  A consumer that needs the
whole clause therefore needs a genuine transverse packing count; a consumer that needs only one
dilation count does not.

This file records, as named lemmas, that the extraction is a consumer of the second kind.

* `Kakeya.edConflictDegree_le_card_filter_subset_dilation` — **unconditional**: the ED conflict
  degree of a shaded plank family at `i` is at most the number of members contained in the
  `C`-dilation of `P i`, for any `C ≥ 11`.  This is the step
  `Kakeya.large_overlap_plank_subset_dilation` exists for; it was inlined in the two proofs that
  use it (`Kakeya/Factoring/FlatPrisms.lean` and
  `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/InnerConflictDegree.lean`) and is exposed here.
* `Kakeya.exists_pairwise_plank_ED_subfamily_of_dilation_count` — the extraction itself, from a
  **bare dilation count at a single factor**: no `φ`, no thickening, no non-concentration
  predicate.  Same conclusion as the `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated` form: an essentially distinct
  subfamily retaining cardinality and shade mass up to `d + 1`.
* `Kakeya.card_filter_subset_dilation_le_of_isThickeningNonconcentrated` — the `φ = a/b` instance
  of the full clause *is* that dilation count (`Plank.plank_thickened_self_dilation_carrier`), so
  the `Plank.IsThickeningNonconcentrated` hypothesis is strictly stronger than what is used;
* `Kakeya.exists_pairwise_plank_ED_subfamily_of_isThickeningNonconcentrated_endpoint` — the
  factorisation, proved: the existing tool's conclusion follows from the endpoint alone.

## Why this is the operative question for GWZ 6.6(B)

The Part-(B) outer family, once presented on exact planks by the homothety
`Kakeya.collarPlank`, is **not** pairwise essentially distinct — that is refuted in
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/CollarPlankEDRefutation.lean`, together with the transport from the
datum's hypothesis on the representatives — so the clause
`Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` exports for it has to be obtained by extraction.  By the
lemmas below the extraction needs exactly one number:

`∀ i ∈ ts, card {j ∈ ts | (W j).carrier ⊆ (C-dilation of (W i))} ≤ d`,  `d` absolute,

and **nothing at `φ > a/b`**.  What is still missing for the presented family is not a packing
count at every `φ` but the pull-back of that one count through the presentation: a containment
`(W j).carrier ⊆ C · (W i)` constrains the *bodies* only through the common homothety
`Kakeya.comparablePlankEnvelope.shrink (windowConst R Cw)`, and turning it into a containment of
the corresponding **representative** planks — which *are* pairwise essentially distinct, by the
datum's own hypothesis — is a separate geometric step.
