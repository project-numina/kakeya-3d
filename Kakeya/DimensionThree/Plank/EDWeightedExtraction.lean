# Weighted essentially distinct extraction for the inner plank family

The cardinality-only extraction `Kakeya.exists_inner_plank_ED_subfamily_of_bounded_conflict_degree`
is too weak for GWZ 6.6(B): fullness is *not* monotone under restriction, so a subfamily with good
cardinality can discard almost all of the shade mass, and then no fullness lower bound survives.

This module replaces it by the weighted extraction.  From a bound `d` on
`Kakeya.edConflictDegree` it produces a single subfamily that retains, both up to the factor
`d + 1`,

* the shade mass `∑ volume (P i).shade`, which is exactly the hypothesis of
  `ShadedBody.fullness'_le_of_subset_of_sum_shade_le` (fullness transfer) and of
  `Kakeya.multiplicity_pigeon_transfer` (multiplicity split);
* the cardinality, which the slab and cardinality clauses of 6.6(B) need.

The `d + 1` loss is *not* free: it is a genuine constant that the consumer must absorb into its
sub-polynomial budget, which is why the small-`δ` threshold of the caller carries a
`d + 1 ≤ δ ^ (-(ηᵢ - η))` clause.

The engine is `Kakeya.IsEDUpToMult.exists_pairwise_subset_with_measure_and_card`; the only work here
is the dictionary between `Kakeya.edConflictDegree` (fixed index first in the essential-distinctness
relation) and `Kakeya.IsEDUpToMult` (fixed index second), which is symmetry of
`IsEssentiallyDistinct`.

/-- **Weighted essentially distinct extraction for a shaded plank family.**

Given a finite family of `a × b × 1` shaded planks whose ED conflict degree is at most `d`, there is
a subfamily that is pairwise essentially distinct and retains both the cardinality and the shade
mass up to the factor `d + 1`.

This is the package GWZ 6.6(B) consumes for its inner normalised plank family.  Nothing is assumed
about essential distinctness of enlarged planks; it is *produced*, on a subfamily, at the stated
cost. -/
