# The `ε`-budget of `Kakeya.plankReduction`

`Kakeya.plankReduction` states all of its sub-polynomial losses as powers `a ^ (± ε)` of the single
public exponent `ε`, and its internal chain runs several independent sub-polynomial arguments.
The bookkeeping needed before that chain can be assembled is quantified after `η` and `ε` but
**before** the configuration.

* `Kakeya.exponent_budget` is the arithmetic of the `ε`-split.  The public `ε` is divided
  into six named positive pieces, one per sub-polynomial argument, and their sum is at most `ε`.

* `Kakeya.absorb_const_of_eps_split` replaces the small-scale threshold the chain used to need.
  Rather than dominating the uniform constant of GWZ Lemma 6.11 by a power of `a` — which forces
  `a ≤ a₀` for a threshold depending on that constant — the constant is carried as the witness's
  own uniform constant, and only the monotonicity of `x ↦ a ^ x` for `a < 1` is used.  The chain
  therefore holds for every `0 < a < 1`, with no threshold and no coarse branch.

`Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.mono_const`, `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound.mono_const` and
`Kakeya.reserveStability_mono_const` are the monotonicities in the *constant* of the three angular
predicates; `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.mono_scale` moves the stability scale and does not move
the constant.

/-- **The `ε`-budget of `Kakeya.plankReduction`.**

The public sub-polynomial exponent `ε` is split into six named positive pieces, one for each
independent sub-polynomial argument of the assembly: the typical-angle selection (`εangle`), the
constant-absorption gap of the representative step (`εrepr`), the good-cover box step (`εbox`),
the dense-ball step (`εball`), the Item 2 assembly (`εitem2`), and the sharp pigeonhole absorption
(`εsharp`).  Their sum is `3 * ε / 4 ≤ ε`, and the two partial sums the refinement outputs
actually consume are recorded as well. -/

/-- **The good-box threshold, in closed form.**

The threshold `Plank.goodBoxes_unionLocal_capture_of_trimmedSlabFamilies` selects at is

`lamScale = (2 C_mult)⁻¹ · a^{εint} · lamLower / (512 · Nov · c_tan)`,

and at the public fullness value `lamLower = cLamPre · a^{η + ε'}` with `4 · εint = ε'` it is
exactly `cLamBox · a^{η + 5ε'/4}` for the configuration-free constant

`cLamBox = (2 C_mult)⁻¹ · cLamPre / (512 · Nov · c_tan)`.

This is the `cLam · a^{ηL} ≤ lam` input of `Plank.denseBoxUnionEstimate_shiftedBox` at
`ηL = η + 5ε'/4`, and it holds with equality, so no slack is spent here. -/
