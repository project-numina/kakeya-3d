# Selecting a fibre of maximal fullness

Proposition 5.1 splits the fine family over a set of outer cells and supplies its inner data
*fibrewise*, but Section 6.6(B) needs a fullness lower bound on **one** fibre.  Passing from the
global bound to a single fibre looks like it should cost a factor `1 / |cells|`, and it would if
fullness were a mass.  It is not: `ShadedBody.fullness s V` is the ratio

`(∑_{i ∈ s} |Y i|) / (∑_{i ∈ s} |carrier i|)`,

so the correct pigeonhole is the *mediant* inequality — a ratio of sums never exceeds the largest of
the ratios of its parts.  Selecting the fibre of maximal fullness therefore costs **nothing**.

The proof is the one-line mediant argument in the form the repository already has it: by
`ShadedBody.sum_volumeReal_shade_eq_fullness_mul`, each fibre's shade mass is its fullness times its
carrier mass, so summing over fibres bounds the total shade mass by `maxFullness × (total carrier
mass)`, and the same identity for `s` lets the common carrier mass be cancelled.

/-- **Mediant fibre selection for fullness.**

If the fibres of `p` cover `s` and the total carrier mass of `s` is nonzero and finite, some fibre
is at least as full as `s` itself.  No cardinality loss: fullness is a ratio, not a mass. -/

/-- **A `c`-refinement loses at most `c` in fullness.**

`ShadedBody.IsCRefinement` is a statement about shade *mass*: `c · ∑_s |Y| ≤ ∑_{s'} |Y'|`.  Fullness
is a ratio, and the refinement keeps the carriers of the indices it retains while dropping the
others, so its denominator only shrinks.  Hence the mass inequality passes to the ratio with the
same constant and no cardinality loss.

This is the step that carries the Proposition-5.1 refinement clause into the fibre selection of
Section 6.6(B). -/
