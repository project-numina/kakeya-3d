# Section 6: the *global* factorisation datum of GWZ Proposition 6.6(B)

Proposition 6.6(B) factors the **coarse `ρ`-tube family** by a *single* family of `a × b × 1`
planks, so its geometry is the mirror image of Proposition 6.6(A)'s: there the outer bodies sat
*inside* a coarse `ρ`-tube, here the coarse `ρ`-tubes sit *inside* the outer bodies.  The two
consequences of that reversal are proved here.

## The scale relation `ρ ≤ a` is forced, not assumed

A `ρ`-tube contains a ball of radius `ρ`, and the least width of an `a × b × 1` plank is `a`, so a
`ρ`-tube inside such a plank forces `ρ ≤ a` (`Kakeya.Tube.rho_le_of_le_prism3D`,
`Kakeya.GlobalComparableBodyFactorization.rho_le`).  This is the exact opposite of Proposition 6.6(A),
where the derived relation is `b ≤ 2ρ` (`Kakeya.b_le_two_mul_of_comparableBodyFactorization`) and `ρ ≤ a`
is *false*.  Proposition 6.6(B) therefore keeps `ρ ≤ a`: it is part of the paper's hypothesis
`δ ≤ ρ ≲ a ≤ b ≤ 1` and it is implied by the factorisation datum itself.

## The exact `parts_are_planks` equality is still unsatisfiable — for a new reason

`Kakeya.PlankFactorization` demands that each outer body be *equal* to an exact `Prism3D a b 1`.
In Proposition 6.6(A) that equality forced `1/2 ≤ ρ` through the longitudinal normalisation
(`Kakeya.Plank.half_le_of_le_tube`).  That longitudinal obstruction is absent here — a unit-length
`ρ`-tube fits comfortably inside a body of longitudinal extent `2` — but a different and equally
fatal one appears: an outer body is the convex hull of a union of `ρ`-tubes, i.e. of *round*
capsules, and a box vertex can never be produced by such a hull.  Indeed the vertex is an extreme
point, so it must already lie in one of the capsules, whose inscribed ball of radius `ρ` would then
have to fit into the box corner; comparing the two transverse coordinates gives `√2 ρ ≤ ρ`.  Hence
`ρ = 0` (`Kakeya.Prism3D.ne_convexHull_biUnion_tubes`,
`Kakeya.not_plankFactorization_tubes_of_pos`), and the hypotheses of Proposition 6.6(B) in the
`PlankFactorization` form were unsatisfiable at every positive scale.

`Kakeya.GlobalComparableBodyFactorization` is the replacement.  It keeps the hull structure and the
Katz--Tao property and demands only *comparability* with an `a × b × 1` plank: containment in one
(the half the Scale comparison consumes) together with the normalisation-free transverse lower bound
`Kakeya.ContainsFlatDisc` (the half that keeps the eccentricity gain `(a/b) ^ β` honest).  It is
deliberately *not* `Kakeya.ComparableBodyFactorization`: part (A)'s datum records a transverse lower bound
and no containment, because there the containment is supplied by the coarse parent, whereas here the
containment is the whole point.

/-! ### The Part-(B) factorisation datum -/

/-- **The global (Part-(B)) factorisation datum.**

The Proposition 6.6(B) replacement for `Kakeya.PlankFactorization`.  A *single* family of outer
cells factors the whole coarse family `Tb` (in the application, the `ρ`-tube family), and the outer
bodies are only required to be *comparable* to `a × b × 1` planks:

* `le_body` and `body_le` say that `body x` behaves like the convex hull of the coarse bodies it
  collects — `le_body` is the containment half, which is what puts a `ρ`-tube inside its outer
  plank, and `body_le` is the minimality half;
* `le_plank` is the transverse *upper* bound: the outer body fits inside an exact `a × b × 1` plank.
  This is the half the Scale comparison consumes, and it yields `ρ ≤ a`
  (`Kakeya.GlobalComparableBodyFactorization.rho_le`);
* `wide` is the normalisation-free transverse *lower* bound, so that the outer bodies really have
  the eccentricity `a/b` that the conclusion's gain `(a/b) ^ β` is paid for;
* `isKatzTao` is the Katz--Tao property of the outer family, which is what licenses the `γ = 0`
  application of GWZ Lemma 6.1 to the outer family (`Kakeya.gammaZeroSlabBound`).

What is deliberately absent is `Kakeya.PlankFactorization.parts_are_planks`.  With that equality an
outer body would be an exact box, whose vertex cannot be produced by a convex hull of `ρ`-tubes:
`Kakeya.not_plankFactorization_tubes_of_pos` shows the hypothesis then forces `ρ = 0`.  Containment
in a plank has no such defect.

The disc radius in `wide` is `min b (1/2)`, as in `Kakeya.ComparableBodyFactorization`, so that the datum
stays satisfiable when `b > 1/2`: a body of longitudinal extent `≈ 1` and transverse half-widths
`a ≤ b` contains a flat disc of radius `b` only while `b ≤ 1/2`.

No longitudinal lower bound is imposed: a cell in `cells` collects at least one coarse body (else
`body_le` applied to a small `K` fails), and a `ρ`-tube already has diameter `≥ 1`, so longitudinal
extent `≈ 1` is a consequence of `le_body` rather than an extra demand. -/

/-! ### Inner slab non-concentration: the Part-(B) concentration step

The concentration parameter of Proposition 6.6(B) is *not* the part-(A) one.  The outer plank family
is Katz--Tao, so GWZ Lemma 6.1 is applied to it with `γ = 0`, where the slab hypothesis is vacuous
(`Kakeya.gammaZeroSlabBound`): no concentration bound, and in particular no cross-parent overlap
loss, is needed for the outer family.  The concentration that *is* needed is for the inner,
rescaled family, with `γ = 1` and a sub-polynomial constant.  The counting core of that bound is the
following.
