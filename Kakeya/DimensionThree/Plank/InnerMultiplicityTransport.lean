# Transporting multiplicity across the inner normalisation

The Proposition 5.1 split (`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51.split`) bounds the
multiplicity of the fine family by a product in which the inner factor is the multiplicity of the
*tube* family on a fibre.  The inner block of GWZ 6.6(B), on the other hand, speaks about the
normalised *plank* family produced by `Kakeya.innerFamilySlabNonconcentration`.  This module is the
bridge between the two, and it is exact: the transport constant is `1`.

## Why the constant is `1`, and why only the shade matters

`ShadedBody.multiplicity s V = (∑ i ∈ s, volume (V i).shade) / volume (⋃ i ∈ s, (V i).shade)`
(`Kakeya/Multiplicity.lean:54`) depends on the family **only through its shades** — the carriers do
not appear.  This is what makes the transport exact, and it is worth being precise about, because
the normalisation treats carrier and shade differently:

* the carrier of the inner plank merely *contains* the affine image of the tube,
  `f '' (T i).carrier ⊆ (Pj i).carrier` — an enlargement, under which essential distinctness would
  not be preserved;
* the shade of the inner plank is the affine image *on the nose*,
  `(Pj i).shade = f '' (T i).shade`, because the inner plank is built by `Kakeya.attachShade` from
  exactly that set (`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/InnerSlabNonconcentration.lean`, the `key`
  construction inside `Kakeya.innerShadedPlankFamily`).

So multiplicity — unlike fullness or maximal density, both of which see the carrier and therefore
pay the normalisation constant `Cnorm` — transports with no loss at all.  Numerator and denominator
are each scaled by the Jacobian of the affine equivalence, and the ratio is unchanged; this is
`ShadedBody.multiplicity_mapAffine` (`Kakeya/DimensionThree/AffineTransport.lean:429`).

## The exposed shade identity

`Kakeya.innerShadedPlankFamily` and `Kakeya.innerFamilySlabNonconcentration` now return the shade
identity as their last clause.  It was already established inside the proof of the former and was
simply not exported; nothing about the construction changed.

/-- **Multiplicity depends on a shaded family only through its shades.**

Immediate from the definition, but not previously recorded; it is what lets the plank family and
the affine image of the tube family be identified for multiplicity purposes even though their
carriers differ. -/

/-- **Exact multiplicity transport across an affine normalisation.**

If each inner plank's shade is the image of the corresponding tube's shade under an affine
equivalence `F`, the two families have *equal* multiplicity.  The transport constant is `1`. -/

/-- **Multiplicity transport for the inner normalised family of GWZ 6.6(B).**

The form consumed by the Section 6(B) assembly: the hypothesis `hshade` is exactly the last clause
returned by `Kakeya.innerFamilySlabNonconcentration`, and `hnorm` is the plank-normalisation datum
already in the caller's hands.  The affine map `f` of a plank normalisation is invertible
(`Kakeya.Plank.exists_affineEquiv_of_isPlankNormalisation`), which is what turns the one-sided image
hypothesis into an equality of multiplicities.

The conclusion is an equality, so it may be used in either direction: left-to-right to feed the
inner plank multiplicity into `Kakeya.multiplicity_pigeon_transfer`, right-to-left to rewrite the
tube-side inner factor of the Proposition 5.1 split into the plank-side factor demanded by the
inner block of `Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal`. -/
