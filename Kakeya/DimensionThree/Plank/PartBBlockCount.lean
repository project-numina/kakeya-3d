# The block-size pigeonhole of GWZ Proposition 6.6(B)

`Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` exports the cardinality clause

`|𝒲'| · |𝒯_W| ≤ Ccard · |𝒯|`,

with `Ccard` bound in the **outermost** existential — before the exponents, before `δ`, before
the family and before `Cfib`, `CF`, `C₀`.  `Ccard` is therefore absolute.  This file is about
where that clause comes from.

## What GWZ does, and does not, do

`Ccard` is **not** one of the seven items of Proposition 5.1
(GWZ Proposition 5.1).  GWZ obtains it from a *uniformization
step performed by hand*, and performs it only in **Part (A)**:

> After pigeonholing and refining `𝕋` and `𝕎`, we may suppose that `|Y(T)|` is approximately the
> same for each `T ∈ 𝕋`, and `|𝕋_W|` is approximately the same for each `W ∈ 𝕎`.
> (GWZ, proof of Proposition 6.6, Part (A))

**Part (B) never repeats it.**  Part (B) selects its outer plank only by shading density
("Select a set `W ∈ 𝕎` so that `λ(𝒯_W, Y') ⪆ δ^{-η}`"), and then closes with
"Since `|𝕋| ≈ |𝕎||𝕋_j| after the uniformization step" — a step that, in Part (B), does not exist.

## What that costs, and what this file supplies

Part (A)'s sentence is a dyadic pigeonhole on the sizes of the parts of the partition
`𝒯 = ⨆_{W ∈ 𝒲} 𝒯_W`, and it uses nothing specific to Part (A): not the Frostman hypothesis, not
`plankF`, not the per-coarse-tube factorization.  It therefore **transfers verbatim**.  The reason
it transfers is that the pigeonhole discards *whole cells*, so every per-cell hypothesis of the
Part-(B) datum (coarse-fibre Frostman, `body_le_repr`, `repr_window`, the fibre bounds of the
fine-to-coarse decomposition) is inherited unchanged on the surviving cells, and the two global
ratio-type hypotheses — the fullness `λ(𝒯, Y)` and the multiplicity `μ(𝒯, Y)` — pay exactly one
factor `Kakeya.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant |𝒯| = Nat.log 2 |𝒯| + 1`, which is logarithmic in
`1/δ` and is absorbed by shrinking `η`.

`Kakeya.BlockCount.exists_dyadicCells` is that pigeonhole:

* `Kakeya.BlockCount.card_le_two_mul_card_of_mem_dyadicCells` — block comparability with the
  **absolute constant `2`**, which is the shape of
  `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51.fiber_card_comparable`;
* `Kakeya.BlockCount.card_mul_card_block_le` — `|𝒲'| · |𝒯_W| ≤ 2 · |𝒯|`, which is the `Ccard`
  clause with **`Ccard = 2`**;
* the mass clause, which is the only cost.

## The constant is `2`, not `1`

`Ccard = 1` *is* available, and is useless: `Kakeya.BlockCount.exists_min_block` shows that the
cell of **minimal** block size satisfies `|cells| · blk x ≤ |q|` with no pigeonhole at all.  But
Proposition 6.6(B) does not get to choose the cell.  The cell is handed to it by the *fullness*
selection `Kakeya.exists_fibre_fullness_le`, a mediant maximisation, and the fullest fibre is in
general the largest one.  Reading the aggregate identity `∑_x blk x = |q|` as a pointwise bound at
the fullness-selected cell is precisely the "aggregate bound consumed as pointwise" defect.  After
the dyadic restriction the correct pointwise constant is `2`, and `2` is sharp for the dyadic
class (a class may contain a cell of size `2^k` and a cell of size `2^{k+1} - 1`).

## Why the pigeonhole cannot be skipped

`Kakeya.BlockCount.not_absoluteBlockCount` and
`Kakeya.BlockCount.not_absoluteBlockComparability` refute the two clauses as stated for a general
block system: the counterexample is `q = range (2n)`, `cell i = min i n`, which has `n` singleton
blocks and one block of size `n`.  The ratio `|cells| · max blk / |q|` is then `(n+1)/2`, so the
failure is **polynomial in the number of cells** — `|cells| ≲ δ^{-4}` — not logarithmic.  No choice
of `δ₀` absorbs it.  The pigeonhole is genuinely necessary, and the constant it produces is
genuinely absolute.

## Effect on the tree

In this development the Part-(B) fine factor family is *unrefined*:
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.fineOutput.outerSet = D.factor.cells` and
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.fineOutput.fiber x = D.fineFibre x`, both by `rfl`
(`Kakeya.BlockCount.fineOutput_outerSet_eq`, `Kakeya.BlockCount.fineOutput_fiber_eq`).  So
`Remark53Prop51.fiber_card_comparable` is not a statement about Proposition 5.1's construction at
all — it is a bare assertion that the *input datum's* cell block sizes are comparable within an
absolute constant, i.e. exactly the Part (A) uniformization, assumed rather than performed.
`Kakeya.BlockCount.fiber_card_comparable_iff_block_comparable` pins that reading down, and
`Kakeya.BlockCount.not_absoluteBlockComparability` shows the assertion is false in general.

/-! ## The pigeonhole -/

open Classical in
/-- **The block-size pigeonhole: GWZ Part (A)'s uniformization step, for Part (B).**

Given any weight `w` on the fine indices — in the application, the shade volume — there is a
dyadic block class `cells'` on which

* all block sizes are comparable with the absolute constant `2`;
* `|cells'| · blk x ≤ 2 · |q|` for **every** `x ∈ cells'`;
* every block is nonempty;

and which retains at least a `1 / (Nat.log 2 |q| + 1)` share of the total weight.  The last clause
is the only cost, and it is logarithmic: it is what GWZ's `⪅` hides, and it is absorbed by
shrinking the fullness exponent `η`.

`cells'` is obtained by *discarding whole cells*, which is why every per-cell hypothesis of a
Part-(B) datum survives it unchanged. -/

/-! ## What the logarithmic factor costs

Two transports, both with the same constant `L = Kakeya.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant |q|`.  They
are the whole price of the pigeonhole: everything else in a Part-(B) datum is a per-cell
hypothesis, and the class is obtained by discarding whole cells. -/

/-- **A sub-family that keeps a `1/L` share of the shade mass is an `L⁻¹`-refinement.**

The carriers are literally the same bodies, so the `ShadedBody.IsRefinement` clause is trivial and
the content is entirely the mass inequality — which is exactly the last clause of
`Kakeya.BlockCount.exists_dyadicCells`.  Composing with
`ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.mul_fullness_le` gives `L⁻¹ · λ(𝒯, Y) ≤ λ(𝒯'', Y)`, i.e. the fullness
budget pays one logarithm and nothing else. -/

/-- **The same sub-family loses at most `L` in multiplicity.**

`ShadedBody.multiplicity` is `(∑ |Y|) / |U(Y)|`.  Passing to a sub-family multiplies the numerator
by at least `1/L` (hypothesis) and can only *shrink* the denominator, so the ratio drops by at most
`L`.  This is the clause that lets `μ(𝒯, Y)` on the left of GWZ's split
`boundMuByWandTTW` be replaced by `μ` of the pigeonholed family. -/

/-! ## The Part-(B) reading

In this development the Part-(B) fine factor family produced by
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.fineOutput` is **unrefined**: its outer set is *all* the cells and its
fibres are *exactly* the datum's own `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.fineFibre`.  Both facts hold by
`rfl`.  Consequently
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51.fiber_card_comparable` — whose docstring attributes it to
"the pigeonholing inside the [Proposition 5.1] construction" — makes no reference to Proposition
5.1 whatsoever.  It is the bare assertion that the *input datum's* cell block sizes are comparable
within an absolute constant: precisely GWZ Part (A)'s uniformization sentence, assumed rather than
performed.  `Kakeya.BlockCount.not_absoluteBlockComparability` shows that assumption is false in
general. -/

/-! ### What the block sizes actually are

A block is the union of the fine fibres of the coarse tubes the cell collects, and those fibres are
two-sidedly comparable to `m` by `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition`.  So, up to `Cfib²`,

`|𝒯_x| ≍ m · |{coarse tubes collected by x}|`,

and **block comparability across cells is exactly comparability of the number of `ρ`-tubes each
`a × b × 1` plank collects.**  Nothing in `Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation` constrains that: the
coarse-fibre Frostman clause is a statement *inside one cell*, and the Katz--Tao clause bounds the
density of the cell *bodies*, not the count of tubes inside them.  This is why the uniformization
has to be performed and cannot be read off the datum. -/


end PartB

/-! ### The restricted datum: why the Part (A) argument transfers

The pigeonhole discards **whole cells**, and that is the entire reason Part (A)'s sentence works in
Part (B).  Every field of `Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation` and of
`Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition` is either per cell, per coarse tube, or a constant, so all
of them restrict *verbatim* — the coarse-fibre Frostman clause and the two-sided fine-fibre
comparability are literally the same `Finset`s, not merely comparable ones.  The following
construction makes that a theorem instead of a table. -/

/-- **GWZ Part (A)'s uniformization step, performed on a Part-(B) datum.**

There is a sub-datum `D''` of `D`, obtained by discarding whole cells — so with every per-cell
field of `D` inherited verbatim — for which

* the `fiber_card_comparable` clause of `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51` holds **as a
  theorem, with the absolute constant `2`**;
* the `Ccard` clause of `Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` holds **for every cell**, with
  `Ccard = 2`;

at the single cost that the fine family of `D''` is an `L⁻¹`-refinement of that of `D`,
`L = Kakeya.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant |𝒯| = Nat.log 2 |𝒯| + 1`, hence

* `L⁻¹ · λ(𝒯, Y) ≤ λ(𝒯'', Y)`, by `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement.mul_fullness_le`;
* `μ(𝒯, Y) ≤ L · μ(𝒯'', Y)`.

`L` is logarithmic in `1/δ` once `|𝒯| ≲ δ^{-4}`, so it is absorbed by shrinking the fullness
exponent `η`; it never touches `Ccard`, which stays absolute.  **This is the missing step of GWZ's
Part (B), and it is Part (A)'s step unchanged.** -/

/-! ## Refutation: the clause is false without the pigeonhole

The two `Prop`s below are the two clauses `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51` asserts, read
for a general block system with the constant quantified **first** — which is what
`Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` requires of `Ccard`, and what the docstring of
`Remark53Prop51.fiber_card_comparable` claims ("it carries the absolute constant, so it is
legitimate input for a constant that Proposition 6.6(B) must fix before the configuration").

Both are false.  They are restricted to `ι = κ = ℕ`, which makes the refutations *stronger*: a
counterexample over `ℕ` refutes every more general form. -/
