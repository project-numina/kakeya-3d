# Overlap geometry of congruent planks

The ED conflict-degree bound of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/EDExtraction.lean` needs the
implication

`volume (P ∩ Q) > (1/2) · volume P  →  Q ⊆ 11 • P`

for two congruent `a × b × 1` planks.  Every dilation lemma already in the repository
(`Plank.plank_subset_dilation_of_angle_le`, `Plank.slab_subset_dilation_of_angle_lt`,
`PrismNDim.perturbation_subset_dilation`) takes an *angle bound as a hypothesis*.  The content of
this file is to **derive** the frame bounds from the volume overlap, and then to assemble them into
an *anisotropic* containment.

## The three frame coefficients

Write `eᵢ := P.basis i` and `fⱼ := Q.basis j`.  A point of `Q` sits at frame displacement
`(s₀, s₁, s₂)` from a common point `p ∈ P ∩ Q`, with `|s₀| ≤ 2a`, `|s₁| ≤ 2b`, `|s₂| ≤ 2`.  To place
it inside a bounded dilation of `P` one needs, for each of `P`'s two thin normals, that the frame
coefficients pair with those displacements at the right scale:

* `|⟪e₀, f₁⟫| ≲ a / b` and `|⟪e₀, f₂⟫| ≲ a` — otherwise `Q` escapes `P`'s thin slab;
* `|⟪e₁, f₂⟫| ≲ b` — the in-plane rotation about the thin axis, which is *not* controlled at scale
  `a`.  This is why `PrismNDim.perturbation_subset_dilation`, which asks every frame vector to move
  by at most the smallest half-width, is the wrong tool: two planks with large overlap may genuinely
  differ by a rotation of size `b` about the thin axis.

## Where the estimates come from

All three are read off the anisotropic slab-traversal estimates already proved in
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Volume.lean`, applied with the roles of the two planks exchanged:

* `ThickenedReprPrism3D.volume_inter_le_weighted` confines the intersection to `P`'s *thin*
  slab and gives
  `|P ∩ Q| ≤ 8 a² b / max (|⟪f₁, e₀⟫| · b) (|⟪f₂, e₀⟫|)`;
* `ThickenedReprPrism3D.volume_inter_le_weighted_mid` confines it to `P`'s *middle* slab and gives
  `|P ∩ Q| ≤ 8 a b² / max (|⟪f₀, e₁⟫| · a) (|⟪f₂, e₁⟫|)`.

Against the overlap lower bound `|P ∩ Q| > (1/2) · 8ab = 4ab` coming from failure of essential
distinctness, each denominator is forced below `2a` respectively `2b`.  No Fubini computation is
performed here; the shear step below is the Fubini-free device those estimates are built on, and is
retained as the standalone analytic lemma.

## The resulting constant

Summing the three contributions against `|s₀| ≤ 2a`, `|s₁| ≤ 2b`, `|s₂| ≤ 2` and the displacement of
`p` from `P.center` gives `11` in every coordinate, so `Q ⊆ P.dilation 11`.  The factor is absolute:
it depends neither on `a`, `b` nor on the planks.

/-! ### The anisotropic dilation -/

/-- **The displacement bound.**  For two planks with a large overlap, the displacement between any
two points of `Q` has, in *`P`*'s frame, every coordinate bounded by ten times `P`'s corresponding
half-width.

This is where the three frame bounds are spent.  Each of `Q`'s half-widths `2a`, `2b`, `2` is paired
with the frame coefficient that matches it, so the anisotropy is preserved: the long displacement
`2` meets the coefficient bounded by `a` (resp. `b`), not by `1`. -/

/-- **Large overlap forces bounded anisotropic dilation.**

If two congruent `a × b × 1` planks fail to be essentially distinct — that is, if their intersection
has more than half the volume of either — then one is contained in the `11`-fold dilation of the
other.  The factor `11` is absolute: it depends neither on `a`, `b` nor on the planks.

No angle bound, frame alignment or centre proximity is assumed; all three are derived from the
volume overlap by `Kakeya.abs_inner_thin_le_of_not_isEssentiallyDistinct` and
`Kakeya.abs_inner_mid_le_of_not_isEssentiallyDistinct`.  The dilation is anisotropic, each axis of
`P` being stretched by `11` times *its own* half-width; an isotropic statement would be false, since
two planks with large overlap may differ by a rotation of size `b` about the thin axis. -/
