# The refinement and typical-angle outputs of `Kakeya.plankReduction`

This file assembles, from the *public* hypotheses of `Kakeya.plankReduction` alone (windowed family,
pairwise essential distinctness, `a ^ η ≤ λ`, `a ^ (-η) ≤ μ`, `0 < a < 1`), the refinement block
of that theorem's conclusion: the plain refinement, the fullness retention and the typical-angle
clause, all with constants that are uniform in the configuration.  There is no small-scale
threshold: the chain runs at every `0 < a < 1`.

## The chain

The whole point is that the *strong* branch of `Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform`
is used, never the weak `a ^ (4 η)` clauses.  Those are polynomial in `η` and cannot produce a
loss of the shape `a ^ ε` with `ε` unrelated to `η`.  The route is:

1. `Plank.card_le_of_windowed_essentiallyDistinct_shaded` turns the windowed hypothesis into the
   plank-count bound `|s| ≤ Cwin · a ^ (-Dwin)` with `Cwin`, `Dwin` absolute.  This is the `hcard`
   input of GWZ Lemma 6.11.
2. `Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform` is invoked at the geometric constant
   `Cgeom = 1` and at the exponent `εangle + εrepr`.  Its statement is a *continuation*: the
   geometric constants and the
   reserve multiplier `kappa` are delivered first, and only afterwards are the typical-angle
   constants `Ctyp`, `Cuni` supplied.  That ordering is what breaks the circularity between the
   shared constant of Lemma 6.11 and `kappa`, which the witness returns and Lemma 6.11 consumes.
3. `Kakeya.findingTypicalAngleOfIntersection_stable_reserve` is then run at that very `kappa`, at
   the exponent `εangle`, with `C₀ = Cwin` and `Nexp = Dwin`.  It supplies the four
   angular hypotheses of the witness, and its own constant `C₆₁₁` is fed back as
   `Ctyp = Cuni = C₆₁₁`.  Carrying that constant instead of absorbing it
   (`Kakeya.absorb_const_of_eps_split`) is what removes the small-scale threshold.
4. `Kakeya.exists_absorb_strongRefinementCoeff` at the exponent `εsharp` replaces the polynomial
   branch `Cref⁻¹ · a ^ η · a ^ ε` of the strong refinement coefficient by
   `Cref'⁻¹ · a ^ εsharp · a ^ (εangle + εrepr)`, which is the only bound with no `a ^ η` in it.

`Kakeya.exponent_budget` records that the exponents used sum to at most the public `ε`.

## The cardinality clause

`Kakeya.card_le_of_isCRefinement_of_fullness` is the honest conversion of a mass refinement into a
cardinality bound: with all carriers of the same volume, `|s'| / |s| ≥ c · λ`, where `c` is the
retained mass fraction and `λ` the incoming fullness.  The factor `λ` is not an artefact of the
proof — it is an equality up to the fullness of the refined family, which is at most `1` — and it
is why the `cardinality` field of `Kakeya.ReductionData.PreassemblyResult` is stated at
`a ^ η · a ^ ε` rather than at `a ^ ε`.

/-- **A mass refinement is a cardinality refinement, up to the incoming fullness.**

If every carrier of the original family has volume at least `v`, every retained shading has volume
at most `v`, and `(s', V')` retains a `c`-fraction of the mass of `(s, V)` whose fullness is at
least `lam`, then `c · lam · |s| ≤ |s'|`.

The chain is `c · lam · |s| · v ≤ c · ∑_s |Y| ≤ ∑_{s'} |Y'| ≤ |s'| · v`.  The factor `lam` cannot
be removed: the middle inequality is the only information available about `s'`, and the mass of a
family of `|s'|` bodies of carrier volume `v` is at most `|s'| · v`, attained when the retained
family is full. -/

/-- **The absolute geometric constant block of the preassembly.**

The eight constants of GWZ Lemma 6.13 that are produced *before* the sub-polynomial exponents `η`
and `ε` and before every geometric datum, together with their validity inequalities.  They come from
`Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform` at `Cgeom = 1`: `cThk` from
`Plank.exists_thickenedRepr`, `cOv`/`Cset`/`Cang` from `Plank.slabMassDecomposition`, `Nov` from
`Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le`, `cN` from the dyadic fibre pigeonhole, and
`Cang2`/`Ccarrier` from the angle-widening and carrier-dilation bookkeeping.

Bundling them is what lets `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab` fix its public `cN := 2` and
`Cbox := Kakeya.plankReduction.boxDilation Cang2 Ccarrier` before `η` and `ε` enter: the whole
block is one value, and consumers read it by field name instead of by position in a thirteen-fold
conjunction. -/

The constants the preassembly produces once the sub-polynomial exponents are fixed, together with
the internal rate `εint` at which the structural clauses are delivered and the exponent budget
`4 · εint = ε` tying it to the public `ε`.  Unlike `Kakeya.ReductionData.GeomConstants` these
genuinely depend on the exponents: `Cθ` is the typical-angle constant of GWZ Lemma 6.11, `cEta`
and `Cres` the polynomial and sharp branches of the pigeonhole retention, `Cref` the
strong-refinement constant, and

/-- **The configuration-dependent output of the preassembly, on one pair `(s', Y')`.**

Everything `Kakeya.refinement_preassembly_uniform` produces once the configuration
`(ι, s, a, b, Y)` and the exponents are fixed: the retained family, the typical angle, the thickened
representatives, the slab assignment, the pigeonhole scalars, the anchor/carrier data, the typed
anchor prisms, and every invariant relating them.  Named fields replace what used to be a
forty-eight-fold positional conjunction, so inserting or renaming one invariant touches the producer
and only the consumers that mention that field, instead of forcing synchronized positional edits
everywhere.

The record carries data (`s'`, `Y'`, `R`, …), so it lives in `Type`; the theorem that produces it
concludes `Nonempty (PreassemblyResult …)`, which is the `Prop`-level existential wrapper.  Nothing
here is ever computed with.

*Classical scope.*  The declaration sits under `open scoped Classical in` purely so that the
`Finset.filter` and `Finset.image` appearing in `fibreCardinality`, `slabMembership`,
`slabOverlapMass` and `pointwiseSlabOverlap` elaborate: `Slab θ hθ1` and
`Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b hθ1 hb1` carry no `DecidableEq` instance, and adding a global one for
these geometric types would be the wrong fix for what is only a finite-set elaboration detail.  The
result is existential and noncomputational, so the classical choice is invisible downstream.

*Reconstructible data is not stored.*  The representative map, the active representative family and
the active slab family are `R.repr`, `R.indexSet` and `R.indexSet.image slabOf`; the old output
returned each of them as a separate witness together with an equation pinning it, and every consumer
immediately substituted the equations away.  They are used as projections here instead, which also
makes the old clause `𝒯 = s'.image repr` disappear — it is `Plank.ThickenedRepr.indexSet` unfolded.
Validity properties of the two constant blocks stay in `G` and `A` and are not duplicated.

Field order follows the conjunction this record replaces, so the producer's anonymous constructor
and the invariant proofs it feeds in did not have to be reordered.  Downstream code must not depend
on that order. -/

/-- **The consolidated preassembly for `Kakeya.plankReduction`.**

One invocation returns, on a *single* pair `(s', Y')`, both the four public refinement outputs and
the whole structural package of `Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform`: the fibre size
`N`, the angle `θ`, the `Plank.ThickenedRepr` `R`, the concrete slab assignment `slabOf`, the strong
refinement coefficient `rRef` with its pigeonhole data `cGood`, `q`, the anchor/carrier data `acd`,
the typed anchor prisms `Pr`, and every containment, packing and mass clause relating them.

This exists so that the final assembly never has to invoke several independent existential theorems
and then *assume* their witnesses coincide.  The internal sub-polynomial rate at which the
structural clauses are delivered is returned explicitly as `εint`, together with `4 * εint = ε`, so
that a caller can see the exponent budget rather than take it on trust.

The package keeps both typical-angle scales: the original `max 2 A(a)` clause and the stronger
`Nov · max 2 A(a)` reserve clause.  Thus old consumers remain source-compatible at the logical
level, while the later dominant-slab deletion can spend the pointwise overlap factor `Nov`.

`a₀`, the constants, and `εint` are all bound before the index type `ι` and before `s`, `a`, `b`
and `Y`, so they are uniform in the configuration. -/
