# The good-cover selection for *saturated* local families

The retired fibre-local good-cover layer built a cover whose local families were
`repr`-fibre-local, `T_q^u ⊆ F_u`.  Hypothesis (5) of the dense-box chain cannot be asked of those
(`Plank.not_localAngleConcentration_of_singleton`), and the repair is to test the boxes against the
*saturated* families instead: `T_q = {i ∈ s | (Y i).shade ∩ B_q^{(1/2)} ≠ ∅}`, for which (5) is a
theorem (`Plank.localAngleConcentration_of_saturated`) and tangentiality is automatic
(`Plank.comparableScalars_of_mem_halfBox`).

This file carries out the selection steps of that route.  Each is stated over an abstract
per-box region `R q ⊆ B_q` — the intended instance is the middle half `Plank.halfSlabBox` — so that
the region-dependence is a parameter rather than a repeated construction.

* `Plank.goodBoxes_saturated_retainedMass` — Step 1: the box-level Markov step on the captured
  mass, returning the good boxes at `cLam = c_good c_stb / (128 c_tan)` together with half the mass.
* `Plank.fibreLocalScore_ne_top` — Step 2: finiteness of the fibre-local good-box score, which is
  what lets the C-linear route divide it by its normalisation.
* `Plank.boxCount_of_goodBoxScore_saturated_var` — Step 3: the covering fraction of the undilated
  representative prism at an arbitrary cover fraction `κ`, with the cut region an arbitrary set.
* `Plank.cover_dilatedPrism_of_boxesMeeting` — Step 4: the covering fraction of the fixed dilation,
  at `κ / C_box³`, `C_box = 4 C_ang + 8 + C_c`.

The shading of a plank is cut against a fixed dilation `(Pr (rep i))^{(C_c)}` of its representative
rather than against `Pr (rep i)`: a thickened representative is the thickening of the *selected*
plank of the fibre, comparable to the plank's own only up to a fixed constant, so the undilated
containment is not available.  Steps 3 and 4 are stated accordingly — Step 3 for an arbitrary cut
region, Step 4 for boxes selected by meeting the dilation — and the whole cost is the enlargement of
the output dilation from `4 C_ang + 8` to `4 C_ang + 8 + C_c`.

Step 1 is `Plank.markov_retained_half` at explicit constants, and its numeric side condition
`1024 c_tan cLam ≤ 8 c_good c_stb` holds with equality, so nothing is wasted.

Both `c_good` (from the middle-half mass capture) and `c_stb` (the refinement loss of the stable
refinement) enter only as parameters, so every constant produced here is fixed before the geometric
data, exactly as in the good-cover section of
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/LocalAngleConcentration.lean`.

fails. -/

/-- **Step 1: the box-level Markov step for the saturated families.**  `T q` is any local family
inside `s` whose members are tangential to `B_q` at `c_tan`, and `Z q` is its shading restricted to
an arbitrary region `R q` (the intended instance being the middle half `Plank.halfSlabBox`).  If the
window `𝒦` captures `8 c_good c_stb a^η · ab · |s|` of the region-restricted mass, then the boxes
clearing the box-normalised threshold

`b · (c_good c_stb / (128 c_tan) · a^η) ≤ λ(T q, Z q)`

still carry half of it.  This is the box-level Markov step run over the whole family `s`
rather than one `repr`-fibre, with the region allowed to depend on the box and the refinement loss
`c_stb` carried; the bad-box charge is `Plank.badBoxes_localMass_le`, which is region-free, and the
numeric condition `1024 c_tan · cLam ≤ 8 c_good c_stb` holds with equality at the stated `cLam`.
The fullness conversion is `Plank.localFullness_of_goodBox`. -/

/-- **Step 1 at a free threshold scale, in discarded-mass form.**  The same box-level Markov
selection as `Plank.goodBoxes_saturated_retainedMass`, but with the box-normalised threshold scale
`lamScale` left free and the conclusion stated on the *discarded* boxes rather than on the retained
ones.

No captured-mass hypothesis is needed: the statement only charges the boxes that fail the threshold,
which is `Plank.markov_discarded_le` composed with the region-free bad-box estimate
`Plank.badBoxes_localMass_le`.  That is what a caller composing with
`Plank.union_capture_of_sum_capture` needs, since the admissible discard fraction there is dictated
by the constant multiplicity and is not `1/2`.

Both forms of the discarded bound are returned: the raw weight-sum form
`b · lamScale · ∑_q #(T q) · 8ab`, which is what a further Markov step consumes, and the normalised
form `512 c_tan · lamScale · ab · #s`, in which the extra factor `b` of the threshold has cancelled
the `1/b` of the incidence count. -/

score is divided by its normalisation to produce a `ℝ≥0`-valued cover fraction: the passage
`ENNReal → ℝ≥0` is faithful exactly when the score is not `⊤`.

The bound is crude and absolute — every summand sits inside a single box, of volume `8θb³` — which
is all that is wanted; no tangentiality is used. -/

/-! ## Step 3: the covering fraction of the undilated prism -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **Step 3: from the retained score to the covering fraction.**  A representative whose
fibre-local good-box score clears `2 c_good c_stb a^η · ab · |F|` has, among the good boxes, at
least `κ₀ a^η / b` that meet its prism, i.e.

`κ₀ a^η · |Pr| ≤ ∑_{q ∈ D} |B_q|`,  `κ₀ = 2 c_good c_stb / c_tan`,

where `D` is the set of good boxes meeting the cut region `P_set`.  This is
`Plank.boxVolumeSum_of_goodBoxMass` fed with the *retained score* rather than with the good-box
threshold, which is what makes `κ₀` carry `c_good` and not `cLam`.  Two monotonicity steps are used,
both in the favourable direction: the score is collected on `R q ⊆ B_q` whereas that lemma measures
it on `B_q`, and the boxes not meeting `P_set` carry no score at all, so restricting the sum to `D`
loses nothing.

The cut region is an arbitrary set, not the carrier of a typed prism: the saturated route cuts
against a fixed *dilation* of the representative, and the conclusion is therefore stated at the
numeric prism volume `8θb²`. -/

/-- **Step 4: the covering fraction survives a fixed dilation, at a fixed price.**  Every box
meeting the fixed dilation `Pr^{(C_c)}` of the representative prism lies in the larger dilation
`Pr^{(4 Cang + 8 + C_c)}` (`Plank.shiftedSlabBox_subset_dilation_of_meet_dilation`), and since a
dilation multiplies the three half-widths, `|Pr^{(C)}| = C³ |Pr|`; so a covering fraction `κ` for
`Pr` is a covering fraction `κ / C³` for `Pr^{(C)}`.  The price is paid once, in a constant fixed
before every geometric datum, and is invisible in the exponent of `a`.

A covering fraction for a prism is *not* one for its dilation, which is why this step exists: the
dilated form is what the saturated route needs, because the region its local families are saturated
for is the middle half of a box, not the box intersected with the prism.

The boxes are selected by meeting `Pr^{(C_c)}` rather than `Pr` itself because the shading of a
plank is only known to sit in a fixed dilation of its representative, never in the representative;
`C_c = 1` recovers the undilated selection up to the harmless enlargement of the output constant
from `4 Cang + 8` to `4 Cang + 9`. -/

The four steps above are assembled into a good cover by
`Plank.exists_goodCover_saturated_aggregate` in
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/LinearCoverRoute.lean`, which keeps every representative rather than
Markov-selecting a subfamily; it is downstream both of this file and of
`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/ShadingAggregation.lean`.
-/

/-- **`(♦)` on the dilated prism, from a saturated good cover.**
The retired per-representative density with the representative prism `P`
replaced by a fixed dilation `Q = P^{(C_box)}` and with the containment form
`Plank.density_transfer_of_boxes` in place of the intersected form.

The change is forced by the saturation.  The intersected transfer wants a per-box density relative
to `U ∩ P`, i.e. for local shades already restricted to the representative prism; saturating for the
middle half of a box *alone* is precisely the decision not to restrict them, so the local
shades here are only asked to satisfy `(Z q i).shade ⊆ (Y i).shade ∩ B_q`.  What replaces the
restriction is the hypothesis `hbox : B_q ⊆ Q` for `q ∈ D`, which turns `U ∩ B_q` into `(U ∩ Q)
∩ B_q` and is exactly
what `Plank.shiftedSlabBox_subset_dilation_of_meet` supplies.  The overlap constant is the absolute
`8` of `Plank.shiftedSlabBox_sum_inter_volume_le`, so `cDia = cDense / 8` is unchanged. -/
