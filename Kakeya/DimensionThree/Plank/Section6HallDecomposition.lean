# The coarse tube decomposition, with the fibre lower bound discharged

`Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.ofUniformAtScale`
(`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/Section6CoarseFactorisation.lean`) builds the Section-6 coarse tube
decomposition out of `Tube.IsUniformAtScale`, but it leaves one clause as a hypothesis
`hlb`, and its docstring says of it: *"Supplying `hlb` requires a bounded-overlap count for the
parent family; it is not invented here."*

`hlb` is the fibre **lower** bound `N / C ≤ |{i ∈ q | assign i = k}|`.  The reason it is not free is
recorded in `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.fibre_subset_filter_of_uniformAtScale`:
uniformity controls the *containment* sets `F_k = {i ∈ q | T i ≤ T_ρ k}`, while a decomposition
needs a **function** `assign`, and the fibres of a chosen function are only subsets of the
containment sets.  A parent all of whose leaves happen to choose some other parent has an empty
fibre.

This file supplies `hlb` by choosing the assignment rather than accepting an arbitrary one.  The
tool is **Hall's marriage theorem** (`Finset.all_card_le_biUnion_card_iff_exists_injective`), and
the bounded-overlap count the docstring asks for is exactly the one the structure already carries:
`Tube.IsUniformAtScale.parents_containing_tube_card_le` says each leaf lies under at most `C`
parents.  Double counting then gives, for every `P ⊆ 𝕋_ρ`,

`|P| · N ≤ C · ∑_{k ∈ P} |F_k| ≤ C² · |⋃_{k ∈ P} F_k|`,

which is Hall's condition for the bipartite system that asks each parent for
`t := ⌊N / C²⌋` distinct leaves (`Kakeya.hallTarget`).  Hall's theorem returns an injection
`f : 𝕋_ρ × Fin t → 𝕋` with `f (k, l) ∈ F_k`; declaring `assign (f (k, l)) := k` and falling back to
`Kakeya.uniformCoarseAssign` elsewhere gives `Kakeya.hallAssign`, whose fibres satisfy
`t ≤ |fibre k| ≤ |F_k| ≤ C · N` for **every** parent `k`.

## What it costs, and the one hypothesis it needs

The output is `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.ofUniformAtScaleHall`, over the **full**
parent set `U.parent` (not the image of a chosen assignment), with fibre comparability constant
`Cfib = 2 C²` around the common size `m = N`.  Since `C ≤ δ ^ (-η)` in every Section-6 consumer,
`2 C² ≤ δ ^ (-3η)` once `δ` is small, so the constant stays inside the sub-polynomial budget.

The one hypothesis beyond `Tube.IsUniformAtScale` itself is the **branching floor**
`C ^ 2 ≤ U.branchingN`, and it is not removable: with `N ≤ C` the datum admits `C` distinct parent
`ρ`-tubes that all contain the *same* single leaf, and then no function `assign` can give every
parent a nonempty fibre, so `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.fibre_nonempty` fails over
`U.parent` for **every** assignment, not merely for the chosen one.  What the floor buys is exactly
`1 ≤ t`.  See `Kakeya.hallTarget_pos_iff_sq_le_branchingN`.

The second hypothesis, `δ ≤ ρ`, is what lets a leaf be tested against its own rescaling in
`Tube.IsUniformAtScale.parents_containing_tube_card_le`; it is available in every Section-6
setting, where `ρ` is a coarse scale above `δ`.

/-! ### What the branching floor is, and what the datum's numeric fields do not give -/


/-! ### The floor is not implied by the numeric fields

The five numbers a proof over `Tube.IsUniformAtScale` may use about the bipartite system
"parent `j` ↦ its containment set `F_j`" are

* `1 ≤ |F_j|` — every parent carries a leaf (`0 < branchingN`);
* `|F_j| ≤ C · N` — `Tube.IsUniformAtScale.card_filter_le`;
* `N ≤ C · |F_j|` — `Tube.IsUniformAtScale.le_mul_card_filter`;
* each leaf lies in at most `C` of the `F_j` — `Kakeya.card_parents_containing_le`, the
  containment form of `boundedOverlap`;
* `⋃_j F_j` is all of `𝕋` — every leaf lies under a parent;

together with what the producers add: `1 ≤ N` and `|𝕋_ρ| · N ≤ |𝕋| ≤ 2 · |𝕋_ρ| · N`
(`Tube.refineToEssDistinctUniform`).

`Kakeya.not_exists_sdr_of_uniform_numeric_fields` exhibits a system satisfying **all seven** at
`C = N = 3`, `|𝕋| = 18`, `|𝕋_ρ| = 4` that admits **no** system of distinct representatives.  So no
function `assign` gives every parent a nonempty fibre there, and the `fibre_nonempty` clause of
`Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition` fails over the full parent set — for every assignment, not
merely for a chosen one.

`parentTube_injOn` cannot rescue it: it says distinct parent *indices* name distinct parent
*tubes*, and two distinct `ρ`-tubes may perfectly well have the same containment set, which is what
the two singleton parents below do.

This does not exhibit a `Tube.IsUniformAtScale`; it shows that the numbers such a structure exports
are consistent with Hall's condition failing, which is exactly the claim a proof over that structure
needs and cannot have. -/


/-! ### The multiscale route: what the grid uniformity buys, and why it is not the floor

GWZ Proposition 6.6(B) carries a multiscale uniformity clause,
`∃ C ≤ δ ^ (-η), Nonempty (ShadedTube.ShadedUniformTubeSet q T (Tube.ssfGridLen δ) C)`.  Its
underlying `Tube.UniformTubeSet` already contains a **function** — `cover.assign k` — whose classes
are bracketed on *both* sides by `card_class_le` and `le_card_class`.  That is precisely the
two-sided fibre comparability a `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition` asks for, so at a grid
scale the decomposition needs **no Hall argument and no branching floor at all**, and its
comparability constant is `C` rather than `2 C ^ 2`.  That is
`Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.ofUniformTubeSet` below.

**It does not remove the floor from Proposition 6.6(B), and the obstruction is at the level of
types.**  A `Kakeya.Section6PartBData` needs its `decomp` and its `factor` over *one and the same*
coarse family `R : κ → Tube ρ`.  The decomposition below produces
`R := 𝒰.cover.tube k : ι → Tube (Tube.gridScale δ N k) _`, while the factorisation comes from the
`Fz` of Proposition 6.6(B), which lives over `PS.parentTube : ι → Tube ρ _`.  Those two types are
equal only when `ρ = Tube.gridScale δ N k`, and the single application site supplies
`ρ = Kakeya.ML2Reduction.plankScale δ ε₂ = δ ^ (1 - ε₂)`, which is a grid scale only in the
accidental case `k / N = 1 - ε₂`.  Nor can it be approximated: consecutive grid scales differ by the
factor `δ ^ (1 / N)` with `N = Tube.ssfGridLen δ`, which is not close to `1`.

So the two routes are genuinely different objects, and Proposition 6.6(B) as its consumer needs it —
with a *free* coarse scale and a *given* `PS` unrelated to the grid — is served only by the Hall
route, which is why the floor is a hypothesis there.  The grid route is recorded because it is the
sharp statement of what the uniformity clause *would* pay for, and because a future restatement of
6.6(B) over a grid-aligned coarse family would get the decomposition for free. -/


/-! ### The decomposition -/

namespace Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition

open Classical in
/-- **The coarse tube decomposition supplied by single-scale uniformity, with no hypothesis about
the assignment.**

This is `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.ofUniformAtScale` with its hypothesis `hlb`
discharged, and over the **full** parent set rather than the image of a chosen assignment.  The
assignment is `Kakeya.hallAssign`; the fibre bounds are `Kakeya.hallTarget_le_card_fibre` and
`Kakeya.fibre_subset_parentContainment` together with
`Kakeya.card_parentContainment_le`.

The comparability constant is `2 C ^ 2` around the common size `N = U.branchingN`; both halves are
sharp up to the absolute factor `2`, which comes from rounding `N / C²` down to an integer.

The branching floor `C ^ 2 ≤ U.branchingN` cannot be dropped: it is equivalent to
`1 ≤ Kakeya.hallTarget U` (`Kakeya.hallTarget_pos_iff_sq_le_branchingN`), and without a positive
target the parent family may contain distinct `ρ`-tubes sharing all of their leaves, for which no
assignment whatever gives every parent a nonempty fibre. -/
