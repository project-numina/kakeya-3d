# The coarse-parent system of a Part-(B) cell

`Kakeya.innerFamilySlabNonconcentration` consumes a `Kakeya.CoarseParentSystem`: a fine family, a
coarse family carrying it with comparable fibres, and a Frostman datum for the *coarse* family
inside the ambient plank.  Section 6.6(B) supplies its data as a
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData`, which packages the same information globally.

This module is the one-way adapter between them, taken cellwise: for a cell `x` of the Part-(B)
factorisation, the fine tubes over `x` and the coarse tubes over `x` form a coarse-parent system
inside the representative plank `D.factor.repr x`.

Everything is already proved elsewhere; the adapter only rearranges it:

* the assignment, its comparability and the leaf-in-parent containment come from
  `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.cellDecomposition`, the cellwise restriction of `D.decomp`;
* `parent_le_plank` is `Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation.le_repr` read at the cell of `k`;
* the Frostman clause is exactly `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.remark53FibreFrostman`, which is the
  *coarse* datum of the factorisation — the fine family is not Frostman, and this adapter does not
  pretend otherwise (GWZ Remark 5.3).

Nonemptiness of the coarse fibre is an argument rather than a derived fact: at a selected outer cell
it is supplied by `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.coarseFibre_nonempty_of_mem_outerSet`.
