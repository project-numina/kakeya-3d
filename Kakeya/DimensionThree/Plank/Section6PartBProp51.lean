# The Part-(B) Remark-5.3 adapter for GWZ Proposition 6.6(B)

`Kakeya.Section6FactorData.section6LocalOutput` is the *fine* (Part-(A)) adapter: it applies GWZ
Proposition 5.1 to a factor family whose **own** fibres are Frostman, and re-presents the output on
the representative `a × b × 1` planks.  Part (B) cannot use it, and must not be made to: in GWZ
Proposition 6.6(B) the fine fibre `𝒯_W` is *not* Frostman in `W`.  What is Frostman is the coarse
fibre `𝒯_{ρ,W}`, and GWZ Remark 5.3 says that this is enough to run Proposition 5.1 on the fine
family.  This file is the parallel Part-(B) adapter implementing exactly that.

## The shape of the argument

`Kakeya.Section6PartBData` already carries, and this file uses, nothing but:

* `decomp` — the fine-to-coarse assignment *function* with two-sided comparable fibres
  (`assign`, `assign_mem`, `leaf_le_parent`, `le_card_fibre`, `card_fibre_le`);
* `factor` — the outer cells, the *actual* cell bodies, the cell map, the representative
  `a × b × 1` planks, the outer Katz--Tao property, and the **coarse-fibre Frostman** datum
  `coarse_fibre_frostman`.

No field is added to `Kakeya.Section6PartBData`.  The representative-plank presentation is already
part of `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51`, so downstream users consume its fields directly
rather than passing through a second conjunction-valued adapter.

`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.toFineFactorFamily` is the Proposition-5.1 input: inner bodies are the
**fine** shaded `δ`-tubes, outer bodies are the actual cell bodies, and the parent map is
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.cellOfFine = cellOf ∘ assign`.  Of the two geometric hypotheses of
`ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCore`, this family satisfies

* `ShadedBody.FactorFamily.InnerHasSimilarShape 2` outright
  (`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.innerHasSimilarShape`, from `δ ≤ 1/2`), and
* `ShadedBody.FactorFamily.HasFrostmanFibers` **not at all** — that is the false statement, and it
  is deliberately never formed here.  Compare
  `Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation.hasFrostmanFibers`, which is the *coarse* family's Frostman
  datum and is genuinely available.

## Where Remark 5.3 enters

The canonical Proposition 5.1 core now has the precise Remark-5.3 variant needed here: it keeps
the fine tubes as inner indices and consumes Frostman control only after thickening them at the
outer body's shortest scale.  The theorem
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.prop51CoreAtScaleOfRemark53` applies that variant to the actual cell
bodies.  Replacing those bodies by exact representative planks, and the accompanying cardinality
comparison, are separate Section 6 presentation data.

Those presentation clauses are isolated in
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51`: a `Prop`-valued structure whose first nine fields are
*literally* the conjuncts of `ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCore` read for
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.toFineFactorFamily`, with the Frostman constant replaced by the effective
Part-(B) constant `Kakeya.remark53Const Cfib CF = Cfib² · coarseTubeVolumeRatio · CF`, and whose
tenth records the fibre-cardinality pigeonholing performed inside the proof of Proposition 5.1 with
its absolute constant.

That constant is not invented.  It is the constant already *proved* to govern fine-family
non-concentration from the coarse datum alone, in
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.remark53_card_fine_le`: `Cfib²` is the price of transporting a coarse
count to a fine count through comparable fibres, and `coarseTubeVolumeRatio · CF` is the coarse
Frostman count of `Kakeya.card_coarse_le_of_frostmanIn`.  Remark 5.3 asserts that this same
substitution is legitimate throughout the proof of Proposition 5.1, not merely in the one counting
step that is already proved here.

Everything downstream of the leaf **is** proved.  Consumers use the fields of
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.Remark53Prop51` directly; the derived nonemptiness and cardinality facts
below contain no additional mathematical assumption.

## What the adapter exposes

Only what `Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` consumes: the selected outer cells, their
representative shaded planks, the refined fine family with its containment and refinement data,
the outer fullness lower bound, constant outer multiplicity, the constant inner multiplicity that
yields the cardinality relation, the multiplicity split
`μ(𝒯, Y) ≤ Csplit · μ(𝒲, Y_𝒲) · μ(𝒯_W, Y')`, and the shading containment.  The irrelevant
Proposition-5.1 output (item 7, the ball-averaged multiplicity, together with its hypothesis
`ShadedBody.FactorFamily.OuterIsAtScale`) is not duplicated.

## What this file does not touch

`Kakeya.tubeMultiplicityOfGlobalPlankFactorisation`, `Kakeya.globalCoarsePlankFallback`,
Proposition 5.1 itself, and `Kakeya.Section6FactorData.section6LocalOutput` are all left exactly as
they are.  Part (B) is never converted into a `Kakeya.Section6FactorData`, and no fine-family
`ShadedBody.FactorFamily.HasFrostmanFibers` datum is ever constructed.

/-- **The effective Part-(B) Frostman constant of GWZ Remark 5.3.**

`Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation.coarse_fibre_frostman` and `Cfib` the fibre-comparability
constant of `Kakeya.Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition`.

This is exactly the constant with which the coarse datum already *provably* controls the fine
family: it is the constant of `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.remark53_card_fine_le`, whose two factors
are the fibre-transport loss `Cfib²` (`Kakeya.card_le_of_comparable_fibres_of_selected_le`) and the
coarse Frostman count `coarseTubeVolumeRatio · CF` (`Kakeya.card_coarse_le_of_frostmanIn`).  It is
*not* `CF`: forcing the fine family to inherit the bare coarse constant would be a strictly
stronger — and unjustified — claim. -/

Inner bodies are the fine shaded `δ`-tubes, outer bodies are the *actual* cell bodies, and the
parent map is `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.cellOfFine`, i.e. the coarse cell map composed with the
fine-to-coarse assignment.  Both proof fields come from the datum: a fine tube lies in its coarse
parent (`decomp.leaf_le_parent`), which lies in the body of its cell (`factor.le_body`).

The fibres of this family are **not** Frostman, and no such claim is made anywhere in this file. -/

The shade produced by Proposition 5.1 is kept verbatim, clipped to the representative so that the
definition is total, and re-presented on the exact `a × b × 1` representative plank
`D.factor.repr x`.  The result is a `Kakeya.ShadedPlank`, which is what
`Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` demands of its outer family.

This is the Part-(B) sibling of `Kakeya.Section6FactorData.outerView`, and the obstruction recorded
in `Kakeya.Section6FactorData.shade_outerView_of_mem` applies verbatim: the carrier is enlarged and
the shade is untouched, because clipping the shade down into the actual body admits no
constant-mass bound. -/

/-! ## GWZ Remark 5.3: the single explicit mathematical leaf -/

/-- **GWZ Remark 5.3 for Part (B).**

Nine of the ten fields below are the conjuncts of `ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCore`, read for
the fine factor family `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.toFineFactorFamily`, with the Frostman constant
taken to be `Kakeya.remark53Const Cfib CF` instead of a fine-fibre Frostman constant that does not
exist.

The tenth, `fiber_card_comparable`, is of a different kind: it is a *proof-level* output of
Proposition 5.1 — a property of the pigeonholing inside the construction rather than one of its
seven stated items — which the Remark-5.3 extension preserves.  It is stated separately, with an
absolute constant, precisely because it is not derivable from the other nine; see its own
docstring.

**Why the outer clauses are stated on the representative planks.**  Generic Proposition 5.1 returns
its outer shading on the `scale`-collar `N_r(W)` of the input outer body, not on the body itself
(`ShadedBody.outerFactoringFamily_carrier`): the induced shading of GWZ Definition 5.7 genuinely
sticks out. Reshaping after constructing that collar would require the consumer to supply

`(body y).cthickening ((body y).scale) ≤ repr y`.

That containment is **false** for a general `Kakeya.Section6PartBFactorisation`: the least thickness
of a cell body is at least the coarse radius `ρ`, so its `ρ`-collar need not fit inside the
`a × b × 1` representative.  Making it a hypothesis of Proposition 6.6(B) would therefore have
imported a false assumption.

Since this structure records the Section 6 presentation of the Proposition 5.1 output, its outer
clauses are stated where Section 6 consumes them — on
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.outerPlanks`, the shading re-presented on `D.factor.repr`.  No reshaping
step, and hence no collar containment, is needed anywhere downstream.  The inner clauses are
unchanged; only the outer family is named differently.

This structure is an explicit input to the Section 6 assembly, not an axiom or an unconditional
constructor.  The canonical actual-body Remark-5.3 theorem is already proved; the remaining fields
are exactly the representative-plank and cardinality contracts owned by Section 6 geometry.

What Part (B) *does* prove unconditionally, and what makes the constant honest, is the special case
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.remark53_card_fine_le`: the fine non-concentration count with exactly the
constant `Kakeya.remark53Const Cfib CF`, from the coarse Frostman datum and fibre comparability
alone. -/

  /-- **Fibre-cardinality comparability**: the refined fibres over selected cells have comparable
  cardinality, with the absolute constant `ShadedBody.factoringAndMultPropCombined.C`.

  **Provenance.**  This is *not* a consequence of Item 4.  Item 4 equalises the *pointwise
  multiplicity* of each refined fibre; converting that to a statement about how many tubes a fibre
  contains would additionally need the individual shade volumes and the fibre-union volumes to be
  comparable across cells, and neither is available.  What this field records is a proof-level
  output of Proposition 5.1: the construction pigeonholes the fine family so that the surviving
  fibres have comparable size, and it is that intermediate property — not one of the seven items
  stated in `Kakeya/Factoring/Multiplicity.lean` — which is being asserted here.  GWZ Remark 5.3
  preserves it, because the Remark-5.3 substitution replaces only the Frostman input to the
  pigeonholing, not the pigeonholing itself.

  It carries the absolute constant, so it is legitimate input for a constant that Proposition
  6.6(B) must fix before the configuration.  In particular it must not be restated with
  `Kakeya.remark53Const Cfib CF`: `Cfib` and `CF` are chosen after `Ccard`, and the public
  cardinality clause of `Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` has no `δ`-power to absorb them into.

  Downstream this field is consumed only through
  `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.card_mul_card_fiber_le`, which turns it into
  `|𝒲'| · |𝒯_W| ≤ Ccard · |𝒯|` with no further loss. -/

/- **Retired unconditional Remark-5.3 constructor.**

There is intentionally no theorem manufacturing this Section 6 presentation package from the
canonical core alone.  The actual-body Remark-5.3 output is available from
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.prop51CoreAtScaleOfRemark53`; representative-plank containment and the
cardinality comparison must be supplied by the Section 6 geometry. -/
-- There is intentionally no unconditional constructor for `Remark53Prop51`: representative-plank

/-! ### The cardinality clause of Proposition 6.6(B)

`Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` must produce `|𝒲'| · |𝒯_W| ≤ Ccard · |𝒯|` with `Ccard`
**absolute** — fixed before the configuration, hence before `Cfib` and `CF`.  The two lemmas below
reduce that clause to a single comparability statement about the refined fibres, so that whatever
has to be assumed about Proposition 5.1 is as small as possible.

The first is unconditional and constant-free: the refined fibres are disjoint and sit inside `𝒯`,
so their cardinalities sum to at most `|𝒯|`.  The second is the pigeonhole that turns fibre
comparability into the product bound.  Nothing here uses `Cfib`, `CF`, or any `δ`-power. -/
