# The Part-(B) wiring: the block pigeonhole composed with the plank presentation

Two independent gaps of GWZ Proposition 6.6(B) were closed separately:

* the **block-size pigeonhole** — GWZ Part (A)'s uniformization step, which Part (B) omits —
  giving a sub-datum `Kakeya.BlockCount.restrictCells D cells' hsub` obtained by discarding whole
  cells, on which the fibre sizes are comparable with the **absolute** constant `2` and the
  cardinality clause `|𝒲'| · |𝒯_W| ≤ 2 · |𝒯|` holds for **every** surviving cell
  (`Kakeya.BlockCount.exists_restrictCells_block_equalised`);
* the **plank presentation** of the constructed Proposition-5.1 output
  (`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.exists_plank_presented_prop51_split`), which puts the outer family on
  genuine `Kakeya.ShadedPlank a b`s in the fixed radius-`4` window, with Katz--Tao, and with the
  multiplicity split unchanged because the presenting homothety leaves
  `Kakeya.ShadedBody.multiplicity` invariant.

This file composes them, and the composition is the point: the pigeonhole discards whole cells, so
*every* hypothesis of the plank presentation restricts to the sub-datum verbatim, and the only price
paid on the way back to the full fine family is the single logarithmic factor
`Kakeya.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant |𝒯| = Nat.log 2 |𝒯| + 1`.

## Why this is the whole of the "swap the datum" step, and what remains

The queued next action was phrased as four steps: swap `Remark53Prop51` for the same hypothesis on
the restricted datum, delete the `fiber_card_comparable` field, take `Ccard := 2`, re-price fullness
by `L`.  It is **five**: swapping the datum does not swap the *conclusion*.  The exported statement
of the Section-6 assembly is over the **full** `𝒯` — it names
`ShadedBody.multiplicity q (fun i ↦ (T i).toShadedBody)`, `q.card` and `maxDensity q …` — so the
conclusion has to be carried back from the restricted fine family to `𝒯`, and that is where `L`
actually enters.  Each exported quantity is checked here:

| exported quantity | how it comes back |
|---|---|
| `μ(𝒯, Y)` | `Kakeya.BlockCount.multiplicity_le_mul_of_subset`, one factor `L` |
| `\|𝒲'\| · \|𝒯_W\| ≤ Ccard · \|𝒯\|` | `|ts| ≤ |cells'|`, `|fib j| ≤ |block|`, `|𝒯''| ≤ |𝒯|` — all in the safe direction, `Ccard = 2` |
| `IsRefinement … 𝒯` | the ambient set only grows, and `Kakeya.ShadedBody.IsRefinement`'s pointwise clauses do not mention it |
| pairwise essential distinctness, `carrier ⊆ B₁`, `maxDensity` | monotone in the index set |
| `λ(𝒯, Y) ≥ δ^η` | `L⁻¹ λ(𝒯, Y) ≤ λ(𝒯'', Y)`, so `η` must absorb `L` — **the fifth step** |

The fifth step is arithmetic, and it needs an a-priori bound on `|𝒯|` in terms of `δ`, because `L`
depends on the configuration while `η` is fixed before it.  That bound is available from hypotheses
6.6(B) already has, and it is supplied here as
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant_le_of_pairwise_essDistinct`:
`Tube.card_le_of_EssDistinct` gives `|𝒯| ≤ C₃ · δ^{-6}` from the unit-ball containment and
the pairwise essential distinctness of the fine tubes, so `L = O(log(1/δ))`.  Note the exponent is
**`6`**, not `4`: the tree's counting constant is deliberately crude (its own docstring says the
geometric truth is `(r/δ)^n`).  Nothing depends on which, since only `log |𝒯|` is used, but the
ledger should record what the compiler accepts.

## What is deliberately *not* done here

No field of any structure is changed.

Also provided, because the next step needs it and it is free:
`Kakeya.Section6PartBData.withShades`, the substitution of the fine shadings.  The Part-(B) datum
mentions the fine family `T` in exactly one place — `Section6CoarseTubeDecomposition.leaf_le_parent`,
which is about *carriers* — so shrinking the shadings of the fine tubes produces another Part-(B)
datum with the same `decomp.assign` and the same `factor`.  That is what will let the *refined*
inner family of Proposition 5.1 (whose bodies are the fine tubes' bodies and whose shadings are
smaller) be fed to the tree's existing inner pipeline
(`Kakeya.exists_partB_selected_inner_ED_package`), which is hard-wired to `D.fineOutput` and hence
to a shaded-tube family.

`Kakeya.Section6PartBData` mentions its fine family `T` in exactly one field,

shrinking (or replacing) the shadings produces another Part-(B) datum, with the *same*
`decomp.assign`, the same `factor`, and hence the same cells, blocks and coarse fibres.

This is the bridge the honest Proposition-5.1 output needs: its refined inner family has the fine
tubes' bodies and smaller shadings, and the tree's inner pipeline consumes a *shaded-tube* family
through `Kakeya.Section6PartBData.fineOutput`. -/

/-! ## The fifth step: the pigeonhole loss is sub-polynomial

`L = Kakeya.dyadicPigeonholeNatConstant |𝒯| = Nat.log 2 |𝒯| + 1` depends on the *configuration*,
whereas the fullness exponent `η` of `Kakeya.factoringAndMultPropGlobal` is fixed **before** it.
So absorbing `L` into a `δ`-power is not a matter of enlarging a constant: it needs an a-priori
bound on `|𝒯|` in terms of `δ`, derived rather than assumed.

Both hypotheses that supply it are already present in the assembly: the fine tubes lie in the unit
ball and are pairwise essentially distinct.  `Tube.card_le_of_EssDistinct` then gives
`|𝒯| ≤ C₃ · δ^{-6}`, with `C₃ = Tube.card_le_of_EssDistinct.C 3` absolute.  The exponent is
`6`, not `4`: that lemma's own docstring records that its counting is deliberately crude (the
geometric truth is `(r/δ)^n`).  Only `log |𝒯|` is used, so the value is immaterial — but the ledger
should say what the compiler accepts. -/
