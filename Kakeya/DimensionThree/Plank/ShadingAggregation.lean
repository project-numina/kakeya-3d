# The aggregate mass estimates behind Item 2 of GWZ Lemma 6.13

Item 2 of `Kakeya.plankReduction` is a per-slab fullness lower bound on the thickened family.  This
file collects the measure-theoretic and combinatorial steps that turn *summed* mass inequalities
into that fullness, with no geometry and no power of `a` in any statement.

**Item 2 is aggregate, not representative-wise.**  Asking every representative individually to be
dense would force a representative deletion (a greedy dense-survivor selection), and deletion
merges or destroys the `repr`-fibres, hence the common fibre size `N` that Items 3 and 4 depend on.
The aggregate form `c · ∑_t |Q_carrier t| ≤ ∑_t |Y_θ t|` is exactly what `ShadedBody.fullness` is,
so it is the honest target, it tolerates non-dense members, and it keeps every representative.
`Plank.fullness_ge_of_aggregateMass` and its converse `Plank.aggregateMass_of_fullness_ge` are that
translation.

**Where the Item 2 exponent comes from.**  Reading
`Plank.perRepresentativeDensity_saturated_dilated`, the per-representative density coefficient is a
product of three factors: the dense-box absorption factor, the per-box local fullness `lam` — which
enters *squared*, the GWZ Lemma 6.8 doubling — and the cover fraction `κ` of
`Plank.exists_goodCover_saturated_aggregate`.  Both outputs of the good cover are linear in the
captured-mass density, so the three factors each cost one power of the local fullness exponent and
the Item 2 exponent is `4η` at local fullness `a ^ η`.

`Plank.sum_ge_of_linear_density` is the step that closes the aggregate at a *variable* cover
fraction: every representative is kept and is asked only for the density its own `κ t` supplies,
the average lower bound doing the work of a uniform threshold.  That is why no
representative-retention factor appears in the Item 2 constant.

/-- **Aggregate mass gives fullness.**  The aggregate counterpart of a termwise density bound:
`ShadedBody.fullness` *is* the ratio of the two sums, so a single summed inequality suffices and no

/-- **The aggregate bound from a variable cover fraction, with no deletion and no retention.**
Every member of `𝒯` is kept and is asked only for the density its *own* cover fraction `κ t`
supplies; what closes the aggregate is the *average* lower bound `hsum`, not a threshold met by a
selected few.  Consequently no cardinality-retention factor appears and the exponent is exactly
`α + ρ`.

The content is linear: sum `hmass`, pull the common `c a^α v` out, apply `hsum`, and split
`a^(α+ρ) = a^α a^ρ`.  No Jensen or power-mean step is involved, because the geometry supplies the
density as `λ² · κ(t)` — linear in the representative-dependent factor.

The equal-carrier-volume hypothesis `hvol` is not a restriction: the anchors of a thickened
representative family all have volume exactly `8 θ b ^ 2` (`Plank.volume_indexSet_eq`) and the
carriers are a fixed dilation of them. -/

/-- **The average cover fraction of the full family.**  The combinatorial half of the C-linear
route, with no geometry in it.

Each representative `u` carries a score `m u` and a `rep`-fibre `s.filter (rep · = u)`, and its
cover fraction is the score normalised by `nrm` times the fibre size — the same normalisation the
Markov step divides by, only never replaced by a threshold.  Given

* an aggregate score bound `T · #s ≤ ∑_u m u`, and
* near-constant fibre sizes `L ≤ #(rep⁻¹ u) ≤ W` on `𝒯`,

the *average* cover fraction is bounded below by `T L / (nrm W)`.  This is the inequality the
Markov step throws away: it converts the aggregate score into a statement about every
representative at once, rather than about a selected subfamily, so no cardinality retention factor
is created.

The two fibre bounds enter in opposite places and for different reasons: `W` bounds the
normalisation of each individual cover fraction from above, while `L` converts `#s` into `#𝒯`.  In
the application both are the preassembly's `N / cN ≤ #(rep⁻¹ u) ≤ cN N`, so the constant loses
exactly `cN ^ (-2)` and no power of `a`.

`0 < L` is not a restriction: on `𝒯 = s.image rep` every fibre is nonempty.  It is what rules out
the degenerate `m u / 0 = 0`. -/
