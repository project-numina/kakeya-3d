# The slab cover, at an absolute angle constant

`Plank.slabwiseDensity_of_preassembly` needs a finite slab family `𝒮` together with three clauses:
a covering clause, an *index* overlap bound at the enlarged constants `(Cset', Cang')`, and a
*pointwise* overlap bound at the unenlarged `(Cset, Cang)` — all three at **one** `Nov`.

Every ingredient is already in the tree:

* `Plank.exists_thickenedRepr` produces a `Plank.ThickenedRepr` from `0 < a` and `a / b ≤ θ` alone,
  with **no** angular, fullness or multiplicity hypothesis, and in particular no reserve scale;
* `Plank.slabMassDecomposition` turns that into a `Plank.SlabAssignment` with pairwise essentially
  distinct used slabs, from `Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound s Y V θ C` and `a ≤ θ`;
* `Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` and `Plank.slab_index_overlap_le` supply the two overlap
  bounds.

What was missing was not a lemma but a **constant**: `Plank.slabMassDecomposition` and
`Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` both bind the one-sided angle constant `C` *before* the plank
scale `a`, and `ShadedPlank.reduction_to_slab_atTypicalAngle` supplies it only at `C ≤ δ ^ (-ε)`.
`Plank.exists_restriction_maxPlankAngle_pinned` removes that obstruction by pinning the angle to a
dyadic value at the **absolute** constant `2`, and this file is the assembly that becomes available
once it has been applied.

## `Plank.exists_slabCover_of_absoluteAngle`

All of `Cset`, `Cang`, `Cset'`, `Cang'` and `Nov` are produced **before** the configuration, and the
two enlargement inequalities that `Plank.localAngleConcentration_of_preassemblyData` asks for,

```
Cset + 4 * (2 * Cang + 4 * 2) + 8 ≤ Cset'        and        2 * Cang + 4 * 2 ≤ Cang',
```

are returned with the max-angle constant already instantiated at `2`.

## Why this collapses the route's `C`-power

`Plank.routePower_of_bounds` writes the Step-3 output constant as
`c1⁻¹ ≍ cBall⁻¹ * (Cmult * Nov * cTan / lamLower) ^ 2`, i.e. `C ^ (9 + 2 m)` with
`Nov ≤ K₅ * C ^ m`.  The trace that settled at `m = 48` — hence `k = 105` — did so because the
*index* overlap is read at `(Cset', Cang')` and those are `Θ(C)` when the max-angle constant is
`Θ(C)`: the constants `K` of `exists_refPose_constants` then contain a cross term `2 ρ Cs` that is
quadratic in `C`, and `Nov` is of order `K ^ 24`.

With the max-angle constant pinned at the absolute `2`, the two displayed inequalities make
`Cset'` and `Cang'` **absolute**, hence `K` absolute, hence **`Nov` absolute and `m = 0`**.
The same pinning
makes `cTan ≤ max 1728 (8192 * Cang' ^ 2)` absolute and, through `Ceta ∝ C * log C` at the
*max-angle* constant, `cBall⁻¹` absolute; and
`Plank.exists_restriction_hasCConstantMultiplicity_two` makes `Cmult` absolute.  The only surviving
power of `C` is `lamLower⁻¹`, forced by the leaf's own
`ShadedBody.IsCRefinement s Y'' s (bodies Y) C⁻¹` and squared by the `^ 2`, so `k = 2` for the
Step-3 outputs — which is `Plank.routePower_floor`'s irreducible part and nothing more.

That is a statement about the *route*, not a theorem proved here; what is proved here is the slab
cover with all five constants absolute, which is what makes it true.

/-- **The slab cover with every constant absolute, at the pinned angle constant `2`.**

Given a family whose one-sided maximal plank angle is bounded by `2 * θ` — the output of
`Plank.exists_restriction_maxPlankAngle_pinned` — this produces the slab family `𝒮` and the three
clauses `Plank.slabwiseDensity_of_preassembly` asks for, at constants fixed before the
configuration.

The hypothesis `a / b ≤ θ` is the leaf's own, and it also gives `a ≤ θ` because `b ≤ 1`; the
`Plank.exists_restriction_maxPlankAngle_pinned` angle satisfies it automatically, its value being
`(a / b) * 2 ^ j ≥ a / b`.

No fullness, no multiplicity, no cardinality and no reserve-scale hypothesis is used. -/
