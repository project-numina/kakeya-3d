# Geometry of one GWZ Section 6 slab fibre

`Plank.SlabFibreGeometry` is the data that the affine slab-to-tube normalisation of GWZ Lemma 6.4
consumes about the fibre of thickened representative prisms assigned to a single `θ × 1 × 1` slab,
together with the constant `Plank.fibreTubeConst` at which that fibre is normalised and the handful
of immediate consequences of the structure's fields.

This module sits *below* the anisotropic ED-packing bridge
(`Kakeya.DimensionThree.Plank.SlabTubeEssentialDistinctness` and its successors), which needs the structure, and
therefore below `Kakeya.DimensionThree.Plank.FrostmanPlankGeometry`, which needs the bridge. It was split
out of `FrostmanPlankGeometry` for exactly that reason; nothing else changed.

/-- **Geometry of one slab fibre.** The data the affine slab-to-tube normalisation actually
consumes about the fibre `fibre` of thickened representatives assigned to a single `θ × 1 × 1` slab
`S`, at plank scale `b`, with a single loss constant `Cfib ≥ 1`.

Every field is used by the normalisation: the prisms must be essentially distinct (so their images
are), shaded by their own carriers and contained in a *controlled* ball (so the images are `b`-tubes
in a ball of fixed radius, which the normalisation then contracts), inside a fixed dilation of `S`
and of the right shape (so the anisotropic map sending `S` to a slab of unit long axes turns them
into `b`-tubes), tangential to `S` (so the short axis is the one that is *not* compressed), and of
positive total mass (so fullness and multiplicity are meaningful).

This replaces the alternative arbitrary-prism input, which had no hypothesis tying `Q` to `S` at all.

**Boundedness is controlled, not exact.** The alternative field demanded
`Q.carrier ⊆ Metric.closedBall 0 1` for every prism of the fibre. That is not something GWZ 6.13
supplies: `Kakeya.redPlankTube` bounds the *original planks* and then relates a plank to its
representative only through the `cThk`-dilation
(`(V i).carrier ⊆ ((Qθ (repr i)).dilation cThk).carrier` and `IsCComparable`), which does not put the
representative inside the same ball as the plank. The field is therefore
`subset_controlledBall`, with the fixed radius `4 · Cfib`. (Independently, radius `1` would be the wrong
window for a genuine `a × b × 1` plank; see `Kakeya.plankWindowRadius`.)

**The shading sits on a controlled dilation, not on the representative itself.** The alternative field
`shade_body : ∀ Q ∈ fibre, (Yθ Q).carrier = Q.carrier` was not something the reduction can supply,
and it must not be asserted. What GWZ 6.13 controls is
`(P i).carrier ⊆ ((Qθ (repr i)).dilation cThk).carrier`: a plank's shading is only known to lie in a
fixed *dilation* of its representative prism, so a shading body built from the fibre's planks has to
be carried by that dilation. The two roles are therefore kept apart:

* the **geometric** object is the undilated representative `Q`. It is the one that must stay
  undilated, because `pairwise_essentiallyDistinct` is *not* preserved by dilation — nothing here
  claims that the dilated representatives are pairwise essentially distinct;
* the **shading** object `Yθ Q` is carried by `Q.dilation Cfib` (field `shade_body`).

`subset_controlledBall` is correspondingly stated for the dilated body, which is what has to fit in a
ball of fixed radius for the affine normalisation; containment of the undilated `Q` follows
(`Plank.SlabFibreGeometry.prism_subset_controlledBall`). The fixed volume/fullness/normalisation loss
caused by replacing `Q` with `Q.dilation Cfib` is bounded by a function of `Cfib` alone, and `Cfib`
is quantified before `Closs` in `Plank.normaliseSlabFamilyToTubes` and before `K` in
`Plank.frostmanSlabUnionVolumeLowerBound`, so those constants absorb it. -/

  /-- The dilated shading bodies — hence, a fortiori, the prisms themselves — live in a ball of
  fixed radius `4 · Cfib`. Exact unit-ball containment is *not* available for thickened
  representatives; see the note in the structure's docstring. The radius is a fixed *multiple* of
  `Cfib` rather than `Cfib` itself, because the `Cfib`-dilation of a representative already has long
  half-width `Cfib`, so it reaches distance `Cfib` from its own centre and the centre itself only
  lies in the working window (`Plank.windowRadius = 4`): containment in `closedBall 0 Cfib` is
  unsatisfiable for a representative not centred at the origin. -/

/-- Nothing is lost by stating `subset_controlledBall` for the dilated shading body: since

(`PrismNDim.self_subset_dilation`) and therefore in the same ball. -/

/-- **A thickened plank is its own `θ`-thickening, after dilation.** A `Plank.ThickenedPlank θ b` is
by definition a `Plank (θ * b) b`, and thickening it again at the *same* scale `θ` rebuilds
`PrismNDim.mk'` from the same centre, the same frame and the same half-widths `![θ * b, b, 1]`. Both
dilations are therefore the same `mk'` application.

This is the plumbing that lets the slab-to-tube API of `Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/SlabTube`,
phrased in terms of `P.thickened θ` for a plank `P`, be applied to the representative prisms of a
slab fibre, which arrive already thickened. -/
