# The index form of the slab overlap bound

`Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` bounds, at a fixed *point*, the number of used slabs whose
`inSlabFamilyC`-indexed shading union contains that point.  The slab-local assembly of Item 2
needs the *index* form instead: for a fixed plank index `i`, the number of used slabs whose
controlled slab subfamily contains `i`.

The two are the same statement.  Collapse the shading of the whole family down to a single point
of the plank `V i` carried on the single index `i` (`Plank.pointShading`); then a slab whose
subfamily contains `i` automatically has that point in its shading union, so the index count is
dominated by the point count.  Since the witnessing point is a point of the *carrier*, which is
never empty, there is no degenerate case and no nonemptiness hypothesis on the shading.

Collapsing to one index is also what makes the argument free of the angular-clustering input: the
shade fibre over the chosen point is a singleton, whose maximal plank angle is `a / b` by
`Plank.effectivePlankAngle_self`, so the pointwise bound runs at the absolute constant `1`.

/-! ## The effective plank angle of a plank with itself -/

/-- **The effective plank angle of a plank with itself is `a / b`** (extra69,
`rem:effectivePlankAngleSelf`).

`Prism3D.planeAngle P P = arccos |⟪P₀, P₀⟫| = arccos 1 = 0` because the prism basis is orthonormal,
so `effectivePlankAngle P P = 1 ⊓ ((a / b) ⊔ 0) = a / b`.

This is the only angular fact needed to run the pointwise overlap bound against a shading supported
on a single plank: the shade fibre over the chosen point is a singleton, and a singleton's maximal
plank angle is exactly `a / b` — not `0`, because `Kakeya.effectivePlankAngle` is floored at
`a / b`. -/

/-- **The one-point shading** (extra69, `rem:pointShading`): the shaded family over the plank
family `V` that shades the single point `x₀` on the single index `i₀`, and nothing anywhere else.

Its carrier at `j` is `V j`, so it is a legitimate shading of the *same* plank family, and its
shade fibre over any point is contained in `{i₀}`.  It is the device that converts the *point*
form of the slab overlap bound into the *index* form: a slab whose controlled family contains `i₀`
automatically contains `x₀` in its shading union. -/

/-! ## The index form of the overlap bound -/

open Classical in
/-- **Index-form overlap bound for the `inSlabFamilyC`-indexed family** (extra69,
`rem:slabIndexOverlapLe`).

There is a uniform `Nov ≥ 1`, depending only on `(Cset, Cang)`, such that for every configuration
and every index `i ∈ s`, at most `Nov` of the slabs of a pairwise essentially distinct finite
family `used` have `i` in their controlled slab subfamily.

*Why this is the point form in disguise.*  Fix `i` and let `F` be the set of slabs in question.  If
`F = ∅` there is nothing to prove.  Otherwise pick `S₀ ∈ F` and the centre `x₀` of the plank `V i`,
which always lies in `V i`; run `Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` on the *singleton* index family
`{i}`, the shading `Plank.pointShading` at `(i, x₀)`, the max-angle constant `C = 1`, and the ad hoc
slab assignment sending everything to `S₀` — legitimate precisely because `S₀ ∈ F` already witnesses
clause (e) on `{i}`.  The angle hypothesis is `Plank.effectivePlankAngle_self` together with
`a / b ≤ θ`.  Every `S ∈ F` then has `x₀` in its shading union, so `F` injects into the point-form
family at `x₀`.

*Why shrinking the index family is harmless.*  Instantiating at `s := {i}` changes the predicate in
the conclusion from `i ∈ inSlabFamilyC Cset Cang s V S` to `i ∈ inSlabFamilyC Cset Cang {i} V S`,
but by `Plank.mem_inSlabFamilyC` these unfold to `i ∈ s`, resp. `i ∈ {i}`, conjoined with the *same*
carrier and angle conditions, which mention only `V i` and `S`.  So for `i ∈ s` the two memberships
agree and the two filtered subsets of `used` coincide.

This is the degenerate-case-free route: the witnessing point is a point of the *carrier* `V i`,
which is never empty, so no nonemptiness hypothesis on the shading is needed and no carrier-form
generalisation of `Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` is required.  The generalisation suggested by
replacing the shading union by the confinement region is *not* available: the proof of
`Plank.slab_pointwise_overlap_le` passes through `Kakeya.angularClustering` on the shade fibre, and
two planks merely sharing a carrier point need not have a small mutual angle.  Collapsing the family
to one index removes the need for clustering altogether. -/
