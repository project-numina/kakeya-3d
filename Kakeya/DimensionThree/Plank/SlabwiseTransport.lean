# Transporting the preassembly hypotheses to the final family

After the slab-complete dominant/good-slab refinement the final family is

`s₁ = s'.filter (fun i => slabOf (repr i) ∈ 𝒮g)`,
`Ydom = dominantSlabShading s' Y' repr slabOf Nov`.

Item 1 is *not* monotone under shrinking the index set — its ball-density clause has the family on
both sides — so it has to be re-run there, and its hypotheses have to be re-established.  This file
supplies exactly those transports, and nothing else; the geometry of Item 1 is untouched.

Every loss here is absolute:

* the fibre-retention rate is the `Nov⁻¹` of
  `Plank.dominantGoodSlab_assigned_fibre_retention_source`, which is what feeds
  `Plank.isTypicalPlankAngle_of_fibreRetention` (through the reserve stability scale `Nov · A`) and
  `Plank.hasCConstantMultiplicity_of_fibreRetention_real`;
* the aggregate rate is the `(2 · Nov)⁻¹` of `Plank.isCRefinement_dominantGoodSlabShading`, which is
  what converts a fullness lower bound.

No power of `a` is spent by any of them, and no representative is deleted: the prune is
slab-complete, so a surviving representative keeps its entire fibre and the preassembly's fibre
bounds are reusable verbatim.

The `cN`-widening lemma is included here too: the preassembly's internal constant satisfies
`1 ≤ cN ≤ 2`, and the public statement asks for the literal `2`.

/-! ## Widening the internal fibre constant to the public `2` -/

/-- **The public fibre bounds at `cN = 2`.**  The preassembly returns a two-sided fibre bound at an
internal constant `cN` with `1 ≤ cN ≤ 2`; the public statement of Lemma 6.13 asks for the literal
`2`.  Both directions are plain monotonicity, and no property of the fibre is used, so this is
stated for bare reals.

Stating it separately keeps the preassembly theorem unchanged: nothing is adjusted merely to make
the two bounds definitionally equal. -/

## Fullness on the final family

No lemma is needed: `Plank.fullness_ge_of_isCRefinement`
(`Kakeya/DimensionThree/Plank/StableRefinement.lean:62`) already gives
`c * fullness s V ≤ fullness s' V'` from `ShadedBody.IsCRefinement s' V' s V c`, with no positivity
or finiteness side conditions, and `Plank.isCRefinement_dominantGoodSlabShading` supplies exactly
that refinement at the absolute `c = (2 · Nov)⁻¹`.

/-! ## The two transports, landing on one retained assigned family -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **The two-sided typical angle transports from the preassembly source directly to a retained
assigned dominant family, spending exactly one factor of `Nov`.**

Transporting first to the whole pruned family `s₁` and then again to `𝒜 S` would spend `Nov` twice
and demand a reserve of order `Nov ^ 2 · A`, which the preassembly does not supply.  Going directly
through
`Plank.dominantGoodSlab_assigned_fibre_retention_source` spends it once, and the reserve `Nov · A`
that `Kakeya.refinement_preassembly_uniform` publishes is then exactly enough — the budget
`A ≤ Nov⁻¹ · (Nov · A)` holds with equality. -/
