# Coarse parent systems and leaf-mediated overlap

`ExternalParentSystem` describes a coarse family of `ρ`-tubes covering a fine
`δ`-tube family, with bounded overlap measured through the occupied leaves.
Two geometric ingredients control this overlap at `δ ≤ ρ ≤ 1`.

First, `Tube.endpoints_close_of_subset` uses the unit core to show that the
endpoints of a contained tube are within `3 * ρ` of the container's endpoints,
up to exchanging their orientation. Second, `card_le_of_separated_in_ball`
bounds a separated family in a ball by the volume ratio
`((R + r/2)/(r/2)) ^ n`. Applying this packing estimate to centers and
directions gives an absolute overlap bound for suitably separated parents.
The exported property measures overlap through fine leaves; it does not assert
pairwise essential distinctness of the coarse family.

/-! ### Volume packing -/

/-- **Volume packing bound.**  An `r`-separated finite subset of the ball of radius `R` about `c`
has cardinality at most `((R + r/2)/(r/2)) ^ n`, by comparing the volume of the disjoint balls of
`r/2` about its points with the volume of the ball of radius `R + r/2` about `c`.

This is the reusable form of the packing step inlined in
`Kakeya.card_le_of_projective_separated_in_cap`. -/

/-- **Longitudinal rigidity.**  A `Tube` is the neighbourhood of a segment of length exactly `1`, so
a `δ`-tube contained in an `r`-tube has its endpoints within `3r` of the containing tube's
endpoints, in one of the two orientations.

The mechanism: the two endpoints of the inner tube are within `r` of core points at parameters
`s₁, s₂`, and they are at distance `1` from each other, so `|s₁ - s₂| ≥ 1 - 2r`.  Since
`s₁, s₂ ∈ [0, 1]` this forces one of them within `2r` of `0` and the other within `2r` of `1`.

This is what the previous "essentially distinct coarse parents" language was standing in for, and
unlike that language it is available at every scale. -/

selected — which is the covering property a greedy construction needs.

within `3r` of the containing tube's centre and its direction within `6r` of the containing tube's
direction *up to sign*.

Both coordinates are orientation-free — the centre because `midpoint` is symmetric in the endpoints,
the direction because the sign is quotiented out — so unlike
`Kakeya.Tube.endpoints_close_of_subset` there is no dichotomy left to case on.  This is what lets
the parent count factor as (midpoint packing) × (projective direction packing). -/

A family of `δ`-tubes pairwise `sep`-separated in `Kakeya.tubeParamDist`, all within parameter
distance `R ≤ 1000 * sep` of one base tube, has absolutely bounded cardinality.

The count factors, and this is exactly why `tubeParamDist` is a `max`: fiber the family over a
maximal `sep/2`-separated set of *centres* (bounded by `Kakeya.card_le_of_separated_in_ball`, since
centre distance is dominated by parameter distance); inside one fibre two members have centres
within `sep`, so separation forces their *directions* `sep`-projectively separated, which is bounded
by `Kakeya.card_le_of_projective_separated_in_cap`.  `Kakeya.card_le_mul_of_fibered` multiplies the
two. -/

/-! ### The external parent system -/

open Classical in
/-- **The external coarse parent system of GWZ Proposition 6.6(A).**

The raw tuple `(r, R, assign, hover)` of the previous signature, packaged.  The coarse tubes have
the exact radius `ρ` that the local plank factorisation expects, and the *test* radius carries fixed
dilation `8`, which is where the geometry of the confinement step lands (the contributing actual
factor bodies lie within `≈ 2b` of a thickened plank's long axis, and the derived scale relation is
`b ≤ 2ρ`, so `4b ≤ 8ρ`).

`boundedOverlapThroughLeaves` is the *only* quantitative property, and it is leaf-mediated: it
counts coarse indices that own a fine leaf inside the test tube.  It is deliberately **not**
pairwise essential distinctness of `parentTube`, a strictly stronger and unnecessary demand, and it
makes no reference to the sticky hierarchy. -/

/-! ### Construction of the parent system away from the leaf scale

The construction below covers every `ρ` with `4 * δ ≤ ρ ≤ 1`, in a single theorem: the *same*
separated family serves the middle and the coarse regime, and only the way its overlap is counted
differs.

* the parents are a maximum-cardinality subfamily of the leaves, pairwise `ρ/8`-separated in
  `Kakeya.tubeParamDist`, each rescaled to radius exactly `ρ`;
* `assign` sends a leaf to a selected leaf within parameter distance `ρ/8`, which exists by
  saturation of a maximum-cardinality separated family (`Kakeya.exists_max_card_separated`);
* containment of a leaf in its parent is `Kakeya.carrier_subset_rescale_of_tubeParamDist_le`, whose
  budget `δ + 3ρ/16 ≤ ρ` is exactly what `4 * δ ≤ ρ` buys;
* bounded overlap is `Kakeya.card_le_of_tubeParamDist_separated`, applied with `sep = ρ/8` and a
  diameter bound `R` obtained in two different ways:
  - if `32 * ρ ≤ 1`, longitudinal rigidity applies to the test tube of radius `8 * ρ`, so any two
    contributing parents are within `R = 97 * ρ` (`12 * 8ρ` for the two witness leaves, plus `ρ/8`
    at each end);
  - otherwise `ρ > 1/32`, rigidity is unavailable but unnecessary: the whole family lies in `B₁`, so
    `R = 2` works, and `2 ≤ 1000 * (ρ/8)` because `ρ > 1/32`.

No uniformity, no hierarchy, no essential distinctness of the coarse family, and no `δ`-dependent
loss: `Cu` is the absolute constant `Kakeya.tubeParamPackingConst`. -/

/-! ### The projective direction distance, as a pseudometric

`Kakeya.projDist_triangle` is the substantive half; symmetry and vanishing on the diagonal are
recorded here so that `dproj u v := min ‖u - v‖ ‖u + v‖` is available as a genuine pseudometric on
directions, without quotienting by `±`. -/

/-- The projective direction distance is symmetric. -/
theorem projDist_comm {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] (u v : E) :
    min ‖u - v‖ ‖u + v‖ = min ‖v - u‖ ‖v + u‖ := by

/-! ### The near-scale regime: fine-family ED packing inside an `O(δ)` tube

At the leaf scale there is no radius slack: a parent tube of radius `ρ ≈ δ` contains a leaf only if
it nearly coincides with it, so the parents must be the leaves themselves and bounded overlap
becomes the statement that boundedly many leaves fit in a test tube of radius `8ρ < 32δ`.  That is
false
without a leaf-packing hypothesis — take many equal leaves — so the near regime genuinely needs
**pairwise essential distinctness of the fine family**, which is threaded in explicitly.

The count is supplied by the repository's Córdoba/Wolff machinery,
`Kakeya.badAgainstSet_count_le_of_ED_thinBox`, whose bound `⌈C_dim * M ^ 2 / c ^ n⌉₊` is absolute.
Applying it needs three bridges, proved below: a positive-volume set is never essentially distinct
from itself, so containment alone makes a leaf "bad" against the reference set; the reference set
`cthickening (99 * δ) (V.rescale δ).carrier` is the `100δ`-rescale of `V` and therefore contains `V`
whenever `8ρ ≤ 100δ`; and its volume is `O(δ ^ (n-1))`, giving an absolute `M`. -/

/-- A tube is never essentially distinct from itself: its carrier has positive finite volume, and
`IsEssentiallyDistinct A A` would force `volume A ≤ volume A / 2`. -/

/-- **Near-scale ED packing.**  For `δ ≤ ρ < 4 * δ`, boundedly many pairwise essentially distinct
leaves fit inside a test tube of radius `8 * ρ`, with an absolute constant.

Two regimes inside: below a threshold `δ₁` the Córdoba/Wolff count
`Kakeya.badAgainstSet_count_le_of_ED_thinBox` applies; above it `δ` is bounded below by an absolute
constant and `Tube.card_le_of_EssDistinct` bounds the whole family at once. -/

/-! ### Packing, leafwise covering and overlap at an enlarged test radius

The `boundedOverlapThroughLeaves` field of `Kakeya.ExternalParentSystem` controls test tubes of
radius `8 ρ` only.  GWZ Proposition 6.6(A) needs the same control at a larger test radius
`Ctest * ρ`, because the `C_NC`-dilated plank test body of the corrected GWZ Lemma 6.4 confines the
contributing actual bodies only to a tube of that radius.

The parent scale is **not** enlarged.  Instead the large test tube is covered *leafwise* by a
bounded number of radius-`8 ρ` test tubes: a maximal `4 ρ`-separated subfamily of the
leaves inside `V` is selected, and each such selected leaf is inflated to radius `8 ρ`.
Every leaf inside `V` then sits inside one of the inflated tubes by
`Kakeya.carrier_subset_rescale_of_tubeParamDist_le` (budget `δ + 3·(4ρ)/2 ≤ 8 ρ`, which `δ ≤ ρ`
gives).  This is a genuine leafwise cover: it is *not* the false inference that a whole
leaf inside a union of carriers lies inside one member of the union. -/

/-- **Bounded overlap at an enlarged test radius, for a parent system at the original scale `ρ`.**

The parent scale, `PS.parentTube`, `PS.assign` and `PS.parents` are untouched: only the *test* tube
is enlarged.  Every leaf inside the large test tube `V` lies in one of at most
`tubeParamPackingConstOf N` radius-`8 ρ` tubes
(`Kakeya.exists_leafwise_cover_of_test_tube`), each of which the structure's own
`boundedOverlapThroughLeaves` field controls by `Cu`; a plain union bound over the cover finishes.
No parent label is identified across cover tubes. -/

/-- **The leafwise cover of the whole unit ball by radius-`8 ρ` test tubes.**

The companion of `Kakeya.exists_leafwise_cover_of_test_tube` with no ambient test tube: *every* leaf
of `q` — not only those inside a prescribed large tube — lies in one of at most
`tubeParamPackingConstOf N` tubes of radius `8 ρ`, each an inflation of a leaf.  The selection is
again a maximal `4 ρ`-separated subfamily in `Kakeya.tubeParamDist`; what replaces the containment
in a test tube is the crude diameter bound `tubeParamDist ≤ 2` valid for any two tubes in `B₁`
(`Kakeya.tubeParamDist_le_two_of_ball`).  The hypothesis `2 ≤ 4 N ρ` makes that bound usable, so
`N` is forced to grow like `ρ⁻¹`: the statement is useful exactly when `ρ` is bounded below by an
absolute constant, which in GWZ Proposition 6.6(A) is the large-`b` regime `b₀ < b ≤ 2 ρ`. -/

/-- **The overlap count for the separated family.**

Given the separated subfamily and assignment of `Kakeya.exists_separatedAssignment`, the number of
selected leaves owning a leaf inside a test tube of radius `8 * ρ` is absolutely bounded.  Two
regimes, both feeding `Kakeya.card_le_of_tubeParamDist_separated` with `sep = ρ/8`:

* `32 * ρ ≤ 1`: longitudinal rigidity bounds the mutual parameter distance of the contributing
  parents by `97 * ρ`;
* `1 < 32 * ρ`: rigidity is unavailable but unnecessary, since the whole family lies in `B₁` and `2`
  works as the diameter bound. -/

/-- **Arbitrary-scale external parent system, away from the leaf scale.**

For every `ρ` with `4 * δ ≤ ρ ≤ 1` a coarse parent system exists with an *absolute* overlap
constant.  This is the corrected replacement for the sorried `Kakeya.Tube.IsUniform.spread`: it
needs no uniformity input, and the constant is independent of `δ`, of `ρ` and of the family.

The hypothesis `4 * δ ≤ ρ` is genuinely needed and is not an artefact.  At `ρ = δ` a parent tube of
radius `ρ` contains a leaf only if it nearly coincides with it (longitudinal rigidity), so parents
are forced to be the leaves themselves and bounded overlap becomes a statement about how many leaves
fit in a `8δ`-tube — which is false without a leaf-packing hypothesis (take many equal leaves).  The
regime `δ ≤ ρ < 4 * δ` therefore requires fine-scale essential distinctness and is treated
separately.

**Universe note.**  The parents are indexed by `Fin S.card` rather than by the selected leaves
themselves.  The `Parent` field of `Kakeya.ExternalParentSystem` lives in `Type`, whose universe is
fixed by the caller, so indexing parents by a subtype of `ι` would force `ι : Type`; going through
`Finset.equivFin` keeps the construction available for `ι : Type*`, which is what Proposition 6.6(A)
needs. -/

There is no radius slack here, so the parents are the leaves themselves — reindexed through

Leaf containment is then immediate from `δ ≤ ρ`, and the whole content is bounded overlap, which is
the fine-family ED packing count `Kakeya.exists_card_le_of_ED_in_tube`.

This is the one regime that genuinely consumes **pairwise essential distinctness of the fine

/-- **The arbitrary-scale external parent system.**

For every `0 < δ ≤ ρ ≤ 1` a coarse parent system exists with an absolute overlap constant, given
pairwise essential distinctness of the fine family.  Two regimes, glued on `4 * δ ≤ ρ`:

* `4 * δ ≤ ρ` — the maximal-separated construction in centre × projective-direction parameter space,
  counted either by rigidity (`32 * ρ ≤ 1`) or by `B₁` containment (`1 < 32 * ρ`);
* `ρ < 4 * δ` — the leaves themselves as parents, counted by fine-family ED packing.

**Uniformity is not used.**  No field of `StickyKakeya.UniformTubeSet` or
`StickyKakeya.ShadedUniformTubeSet` enters, and there is no `δ ^ (-η)` loss: `Cparent` depends on
nothing but the dimension.  What the near regime does consume is pairwise ED of the *fine* family —
not of the coarse parents, and not any hierarchy datum. -/
