# The typed prism view of a thickened anchor

`Plank.ThickenedRepr` returns its anchors as bare `Plank.EnsemblePrism`s, i.e. as
`PrismNDim 3`s with no record of their widths.  Every consumer that has to *cut* a shading against
an anchor — `Plank.exists_goodCover_saturated_aggregate` and, through it,
`Kakeya.exists_absorb_refined_fullness` and the internal Item 2 clause — needs the typed
`Prism3D (θ·b) b 1` view instead, together with the anchor's angle to the slab.

Both are recoverable from the `Plank.ThickenedRepr` itself, and this file does that once.  No
geometric content is added by the *view*: an active anchor **is** the undilated standard thickening
of the selected plank (`Plank.ThickenedRepr.repr_eq`), so its thickness vector is literally
`![θ·b, b, 1]` and the typed reading is the same prism at a more informative type.

The angle bound is the content, and it costs an enlarged but uniform constant.  The selected plank's
thickening is not essentially distinct from the thickening of any plank of the anchor's fibre
(`Plank.ThickenedRepr.notEssentiallyDistinct_repr`), hence within `8·θ` of it
(`Plank.thickening_angle_lt_of_not_essentiallyDistinct`); chaining that with the fibre member's own
`Cang·θ` bound through the quasi-triangle inequality `Prism3D.angle_le_two_mul_add_angle` costs the
absolute factor `2`, giving `2·Cang + 16`.

`Plank.inSlabFamilyC_mono` is here for the same reason: the enlarged angle constant has to be fed
back into the slab family, and consumers take a *single* constant in both slots.

the slab assignment produces, and the internal Item 2 clause consumes a single constant in both

/-- **The typed `Prism3D` view of a thickened anchor, with its slab angle** (extra69,
`rem:existsTypedAnchorPrism`).

Every active anchor of a `Plank.ThickenedRepr` is, by `Plank.ThickenedRepr.repr_eq`, the undilated
standard thickening of the selected plank, hence a `PrismNDim` whose thickness vector is
`![θ·b, b, 1]`.  So the typed view exists and is the identity on the underlying prism; no geometric
content is added.

The angle clause is the content.  If the whole `repr`-fibre of an anchor lies in the controlled
slab subfamily of a slab `S`, then the anchor's own plane meets `S` at angle at most
`(2·Cang + 16)·θ`: the selected plank's thickening is not essentially distinct from the thickening
of any plank of the fibre, so the two planes are within `8·θ`
(`Plank.thickening_angle_lt_of_not_essentiallyDistinct`), and chaining that with the fibre member's
own `Cang·θ` bound through the quasi-triangle inequality `Prism3D.angle_le_two_mul_add_angle` costs
the absolute factor `2`.

This is exactly the anchor-angle input of the internal Item 2 clause, at the enlarged but still
uniform angle constant `2·Cang + 16`. -/

/-- **The typed anchor's angle to an arbitrary slab, pointwise in the plank** (extra69,
`rem:angleTypedAnchorLeTwoMulAdd`).

`Plank.exists_typedAnchorPrism` bounds `∠(Pr t, S)` only when the *whole* `repr`-fibre of `t` lies
in the controlled slab subfamily of `S`.  The assembly needs the bound at a slab that the anchor
was not assigned to, where that hypothesis is unavailable, so the bound has to be stated pointwise
in a single plank instead:

  `∠(Pr (repr i), S) ≤ 2 · ∠(V i, S) + 16 · θ`   for every `i ∈ s` and every slab `S`.

The geometry is exactly the chain of `Plank.exists_typedAnchorPrism`: the anchor **is** the
undilated standard thickening of the selected plank (`Plank.ThickenedRepr.repr_eq`), so it has the
same basis and hence the same angle to `S` as `V (sel i)`; the selected plank's thickening is not
essentially distinct from `i`'s (`Plank.ThickenedRepr.notEssentiallyDistinct_repr`), hence within
`8·θ` of it (`Plank.thickening_angle_lt_of_not_essentiallyDistinct`); and the quasi-triangle
inequality `Prism3D.angle_le_two_mul_add_angle` chains the two at the absolute cost `2`.

Only the *typed view* is needed, not the way it was constructed, so the statement takes an
arbitrary `Pr` sitting over the anchors.  That is what lets a caller apply it to the `Pr` already
returned by `Kakeya.representativeWitness_strong_uniform`. -/

This explicit bound avoids relying on `positivity`, which targets strict positivity rather than a
`1 ≤ _` goal. -/
