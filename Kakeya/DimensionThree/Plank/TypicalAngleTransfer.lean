# Transporting the two-sided typical angle across a deletion

`Kakeya.HasMaxPlankAngleBound` is monotone under shrinking the family, so the slab layer
survives an arbitrary deletion for free.  The two-sided `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` is
**not** monotone: deleting
planks can destroy the lower bound `θ ≤ C · M(fibre)`, and a full-fibre comparability statement
recovers only that, not the sub-fibre stability clause that `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` also
demands.

This file supplies the missing step.  The observation is a bookkeeping one about the two stability
scales: a scale really must be *spent* on the deletion.  If the surviving fibre keeps a `q`-fraction
of the original fibre, then a sub-fibre keeping an `A⁻¹`-fraction of the *surviving* fibre
keeps only an `A⁻¹ · q`-fraction of the original one.  So the two-sided predicate at scale `A`
on the deleted family follows from the stability clause at any old scale `B` whose budget covers
the deletion,
`A ≤ q · B` — the deletion consumes `q`, and what is left is the scale of the conclusion.

`Plank.isTypicalPlankAngle_of_fibreRetention` is that general statement, with the budget written
multiplicatively on purpose: the equivalent `A ≤ B / q` would invite zero and inverse boundary
problems.

The general form is what lets a lossy deletion of retained fraction `q` be paid for out of a
*reserve* scale, instead of forcing the reserve to be exactly one factor of `A`.  Composing with
`Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle.mono_scale` then delivers the conclusion at any smaller scale.

/-- **The two-sided typical angle survives a deletion whose retained fraction fits the scale
budget (extra66, `note:isTypicalPlankAngleOfFibreKeep`).**

Let `(s₂, Y₂)` be obtained from `(s, Y₁)` by shrinking the index set and the shades, in such a way
that at every point of the new union the new fibre retains a `q`-fraction of the old fibre
(`hkeep`).  Let `B` be an old stability scale whose budget covers the deletion, `A ≤ q · B`
(`hbudget`).  If the old family satisfies the two-sided comparability at constant `C` for *every*
sub-fibre retaining a `B⁻¹`-fraction (`hstab`), then the new family satisfies
`Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankAngle` at `(θ, C, A)`.

Both clauses of `Kakeya.IsTypicalPlankFibre` come out of `hstab`: the full-fibre one by taking the
new fibre itself as the sub-fibre (legitimate because `1 ≤ A ≤ q · B` gives `B⁻¹ ≤ q`, so `hkeep`
already places it above the `B⁻¹`-threshold), and the sub-fibre one by composing the two fractions,
where `A ≤ q · B` is exactly `B⁻¹ ≤ A⁻¹ · q`.

The budget is stated multiplicatively rather than as `A ≤ B / q`, to keep the statement away from
the zero and inverse boundary cases.  No positivity hypothesis on `q` is imposed, since
`0 < 1 ≤ A ≤ q · B` with `0 ≤ B` already forces `0 < q` and `0 < B`. -/
