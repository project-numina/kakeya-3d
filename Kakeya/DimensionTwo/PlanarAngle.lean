# The planar angle between two planar prisms

For two planar prisms `Q`, `Q'` (terms of `PrismNDim 2 E E`, with orthonormal axes
`Q.basis`, `Q'.basis`) we define `PrismNDim.planarAngle Q Q'`, an orientation-free measure of how
transverse the two prisms are.  Geometrically it is `sin α` for `α` the angle between the two
frames.  It is defined as the absolute inner product `|⟪Q.basis 0, Q'.basis 1⟫|` between the first
axis of `Q` and the second axis of `Q'`, and the API records that this equals

* `|ω (Q.basis i) (Q'.basis i)|` for either `i` (the absolute signed area between the two long axes,
  or between the two short axes), for *any* orientation `o` with `ω = o.areaForm`
  (`planarAngle_eq_abs_areaForm`);
* `|⟪Q.basis i, Q'.basis i.rev⟫|` for either `i` (the absolute inner product between a long axis of
  one and the short axis of the other) (`planarAngle_eq_abs_inner`).

The point of `planarAngle` is to avoid choosing an orientation: `o.areaForm` flips sign under
`o ↦ -o`, but its absolute value, and hence `planarAngle`, does not depend on `o`.
