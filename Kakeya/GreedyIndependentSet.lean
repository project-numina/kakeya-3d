# Greedy selection in a bounded-degree graph

A finite symmetric irreflexive relation of degree at most `D` on a weighted finite index set
admits an independent subset carrying at least a `1 / (D + 1)` fraction of the total weight
(`Kakeya.exists_pairwise_not_of_degree_le`, blueprint `lem:greedyWeightedIndependentSet`).

This is the combinatorial half of the subfamily selection of the plank presentation: the
clustering relation on the enclosing planks has bounded degree
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound`), and the selection
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilySelection`) is this lemma applied to it, with the shaded
masses as weights.

Mathlib has `SimpleGraph.IsIndepSet` and the existence of *maximum* independent sets, but no
weighted greedy bound of this shape. The weights live in `ℝ≥0∞` and no finiteness is needed:
if some weight is `∞` then the greedily chosen maximal weight is `∞` and both sides of the
conclusion are `∞`.

The blueprint's auxiliary statement `lem:sumLeCardMulMax` — a finite sum in `[0, ∞]` is at
most the cardinality times a uniform upper bound for its terms — is Mathlib's
`Finset.sum_le_card_nsmul` and is not restated here.

/-- **Greedy selection in a bounded-degree graph**.

Let `r` be a symmetric irreflexive relation on a finite index set `J` all of whose degrees are
at most `D`, and let `y` be `[0, ∞]`-valued weights. Then some `r`-independent `J' ⊆ J`
carries at least a `1 / (D + 1)` fraction of the total weight, stated multiplicatively as
`∑_{J} y ≤ (D + 1) ∑_{J'} y` so that no division in `ℝ≥0∞` occurs.

The proof is strong induction on `#J`: pick `i` maximising `y`, discard its closed
neighbourhood — whose weight is at most `(D + 1) y i` by `Finset.sum_le_card_nsmul` — and
recurse on the rest.

The degree bound is stated with `Set.ncard` and not with `Finset.card`, so that `r` needs no
`DecidableRel` instance. At the one call site
(`Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankSubfamilySelection`) the relation is
`fun i j ↦ ¬ IsEssentiallyDistinct …`, which is not decidable, and every caller would
otherwise have to insert `Classical.decRel`; `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.plankClusterBound` already
states its degree bound in the `Set.ncard` form. -/
