# Greedy selection in a bounded-degree graph, with the cardinality clause

`Kakeya.exists_pairwise_not_of_degree_le` retains a `1/(D+1)` fraction of **one** weight `y`.
Two of the fields of `Kakeya.VeryNotSticky.ThickPlankPresentation` are retention clauses for
*different* weights on the *same* selected subfamily — `sel_card` at the constant weight `1`
and `fullness_ge` at the shaded mass — so a second, independent call of the greedy lemma at
the second weight does **not** discharge them: it returns a second, unrelated subfamily.

Retaining two arbitrary weights at once is genuinely impossible for an independent subset of a
bounded-degree graph (a clique on `D + 1` vertices admits only singletons, and two weights may
be concentrated on different vertices). What *is* true, and is what this file records, is that
the greedy set of `Kakeya.exists_pairwise_not_of_degree_le` is **maximal**, and a maximal
independent set of a graph of degree at most `D` always carries a `1/(D+1)` fraction of the
*cardinality*: every discarded vertex is adjacent to a selected one, and each selected vertex
absorbs at most `D` of them. So the single greedy run at the weight `y` retains `y` *and* the
cardinality simultaneously.

The proof is `Kakeya.exists_pairwise_not_of_degree_le`'s strong induction on `#J`, carrying the
second invariant `#S ≤ (D+1) #ans` alongside `∑_S y ≤ (D+1) ∑_ans y`. Both come from the same
split `S = N ⊎ (S \ N)` at the greedily chosen vertex `i`: the closed neighbourhood `N` has at
most `D + 1` elements and weight at most `(D + 1) y i`, and `ans = insert i A` with `i ∉ A`.

The one-weight statement is left exactly as it is; this is an additive twin.

/-- **Greedy selection in a bounded-degree graph, retaining the weight and the cardinality**
(the twin of `Kakeya.exists_pairwise_not_of_degree_le`).

Same hypotheses, same subfamily, one further conclusion: `#J ≤ (D + 1) #J'`. The cardinality
clause is not a second application of the weighted statement at the constant weight — that
would produce a different `J'` — but the *maximality* of the greedy set, proved along the same
induction. -/
