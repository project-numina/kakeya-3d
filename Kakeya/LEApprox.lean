# The `⪅` ("less than or approximately") notation

Many estimates in the proof are only true up to factors of the form `log (1 / δ)` or
`log |𝒱|`, which are harmless distractions. To streamline these arguments we follow
the convention that, when `X` and `Y` are quantities depending on an (often implicit)
parameter `ρ : ℝ≥0`, we write

  `X ⪅ Y`

to mean that for every `ε > 0` there is a constant `C = C ε` such that
`X ρ ≤ C * ρ ^ (-ε) * Y ρ` for all `0 < ρ ≤ 1`. Since `ρ ^ (-ε) → 1` as `ε → 0`, this absorbs
any sub-polynomial loss (such as the logarithmic factors above) into the inequality.

(The bound is only required for `0 < ρ ≤ 1`, matching the intended domain: `ρ` is always a
ratio in `(0, 1]` such as `δ`, `|𝒱|⁻¹`, or `a / A`. Requiring it at `ρ = 0` would force
`X 0 = 0`, since `(0 : ℝ≥0) ^ (-ε) = 0`; and requiring it for large `ρ` would make the
`ρ ^ (-ε)` factor a gain rather than a loss, so that e.g. `log (1 / ρ) ⪅ 1` would fail.)

This file defines this relation as `LEApprox` and introduces the scoped notation `X ⪅ Y`
for it (together with the reversed `X ⪆ Y`).

Alongside `⪅` we also define the coarser, constant-factor relations that appear in the same
arguments:

* `X ≲ Y` (`LEsssim`): `X ρ ≤ C * Y ρ` for some constant `C` and all `0 < ρ ≤ 1`. This is the
  usual harmonic-analysis convention, hiding only absolute constants (those allowed to depend
  on fixed parameters such as the dimension, but not on `ρ`). It carries no `ρ ^ (-ε)` factor.
* `X ∼ Y` (`Comparable`): the two-sided version of `≲`, i.e. `X ≲ Y` and `Y ≲ X`.
* `X ≈ Y` (`ApproxEq`): the two-sided version of `⪅`, i.e. `X ⪅ Y` and `Y ⪅ X`.

/-- `LEApprox X Y` (notation `X ⪅ Y`) holds when, for every `ε > 0`, there is a constant
`C` such that `X ρ ≤ C * ρ ^ (-ε) * Y ρ` for all `ρ : ℝ≥0` with `0 < ρ ≤ 1`.

Here `X Y : ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0` are thought of as quantities depending on an implicit parameter
`ρ`. The factor `ρ ^ (-ε)` lets the bound absorb any sub-polynomial loss (e.g. factors of
`log (1 / δ)` or `log |𝒱|`) uniformly in `ρ`; this is why the bound is only asked for on the
intended domain `0 < ρ ≤ 1`, where `ρ ^ (-ε) ≥ 1`.

## The basic calculus of `⪅`

The following elementary facts are used wherever `⪅` is manipulated: the loss factor is really a
loss on the intended domain, `⪅` is monotone in its left argument, and `⪅ 1` is stable under
adding and multiplying by constants and (given a positive lower bound) under taking reciprocals.

They are followed by the logarithmic estimates that make `⪅` useful in the first place: the
unbounded loss `log₂ (1 / ρ)` is `⪅ 1`, and the logarithm of a ratio splits pointwise into a
constant part and such a logarithmic part. Combining the two gives
`Kakeya.toNNReal_logb_div_leApprox_one`: if `b / a ≲ ρ⁻¹` then `(log₂ (b / a))₊ ⪅ 1`.
-/

/-- **The loss factor is at least `1` on the intended domain**:
for `0 ≤ ε` and `0 < ρ ≤ 1` the factor `ρ ^ (-ε)` appearing in `Kakeya.LEApprox` is a loss rather
than a gain.

Only `0 ≤ ε` is needed, although `Kakeya.LEApprox` is applied with `0 < ε`. -/

/-- **The logarithm of a ratio bounded by `ρ⁻¹` is `⪅ 1`**.

Following the convention (ii′) of the blueprint section `defnLessapprox`, the implicit parameter
of `Kakeya.LEApprox` is `ρ = |𝒱|⁻¹`, so the hypothesis `b / a ≲ |𝒱|` reads
`(fun ρ => b ρ / a ρ) ≲ fun ρ => ρ⁻¹`.

The conclusion is stated for the positive part `Real.toNNReal`, so that both sides are `ℝ≥0`
valued as `Kakeya.LEApprox` requires; since `a ≤ b` is *not* assumed, `log₂ (b / a)` may genuinely
be negative and the positive part is not merely a change of type.

The proof is the composition of the pointwise splitting `Kakeya.toNNReal_logb_div_le` with
`Kakeya.toNNReal_logb_inv_leApprox_one`, `Kakeya.LEApprox.const_add_one` and
`Kakeya.LEApprox.mono_left`. -/
