# Trigonometric helpers

Consequences of Jordan's inequality `2φ/π ≤ sin φ`: for unit vectors in `ℝ³` whose first
coordinate is constrained by a cosine, and for the two-sided comparison between an arc
`arccos s` and the chord it subtends, together with the two facts about `sin` and the
unoriented vector angle that the chord-angle bound `Tube.norm_perp_direction_le_of_chord`
needs and Mathlib does not have.

## Blueprint correspondence

* `Real.sin_add_le_sin_add_sin` ↔ `lem:sinAddLe`;
* `InnerProductGeometry.norm_sub_inner_smul_eq_sin_angle` ↔ `lem:normPerpEqSinAngle`.

/-- **Sine is subadditive on a quarter turn**.

Mathlib has no `Real.sin_add_le`; the bound is needed at the point where the chord-angle
argument splits an angle into two nonnegative pieces. -/

/-- **The transverse part of a unit vector is the sine of the angle**. For unit vectors `e`, `f`,
the component of `f` orthogonal to `e`
has norm `sin ∠(e, f)`; this is the bridge between the transverse bookkeeping of tubes, which
is stated in norms, and the angle triangle inequality, which is stated in angles. -/
