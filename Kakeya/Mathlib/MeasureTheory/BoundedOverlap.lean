# Bounded-overlap union estimate

If a finite family of measurable sets `A i` has *bounded overlap* — every point
belongs to at most `C` of them — then the sum of their measures is at most `C`
times the measure of their union.

This is the abstract measure-theoretic content behind the bounded-overlap step in
the plank-to-tube reduction (GWZ Lemma 6.13, item 3): the slab subfamilies
`U(𝒫'_S, Y'_S)` overlap boundedly, so `∑_S |U(𝒫'_S, Y'_S)| ≤ C |U(𝒫', Y')|`.

/-- **Bounded-overlap union estimate.** Let `A : ι → Set α` be a finite family of
measurable sets indexed by `s`, and suppose every point lies in at most `C` of them
(`{i ∈ s | x ∈ A i}.card ≤ C` for all `x`). Then
`∑ i ∈ s, μ (A i) ≤ C * μ (⋃ i ∈ s, A i)`.

The proof writes each measure as the Lebesgue integral of an indicator, swaps sum
and integral, and bounds the pointwise overlap count `∑ i, 𝟙_{A i}(x)` by
`C · 𝟙_{⋃ A i}(x)`. -/

/-- **Layer cake for a finite family of sets.**  For a finite family of measurable sets `A i`,
`i ∈ s`, and an arbitrary set `B`, the total mass of the family inside `B` is the integral over
`B` of the overlap count:
`∑ i ∈ s, μ (A i ∩ B) = ∫⁻ x in B, #{i ∈ s | x ∈ A i} ∂μ`.

No measurability is required of `B`: the identity is Fubini for a finite sum of indicators against
the restricted measure `μ.restrict B`, and `Measure.restrict_apply` only needs the sets `A i` to be
measurable.  This is the linear companion of
`MeasureTheory.sum_measure_le_mul_measure_biUnion_of_card_filter_le`; the latter is the special
case where the count is bounded by a constant.

The set-integral form is what distinguishes this from
`MeasureTheory.sum_measure_inter_eq_lintegral_card_filter`, which fixes the intersected set and
indexes the other factor. -/
