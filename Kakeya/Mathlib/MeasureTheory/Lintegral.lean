# Lower integrals over finite unions

Finite subadditivity of the lower integral `∫⁻ x in A, f x ∂μ` in the set `A`. It requires neither
measurability of `f` or of the sets nor disjointness of the pieces: the only properties used are
monotonicity of `Measure.restrict` in the set and monotonicity of the lower integral in the measure.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.lintegral_biUnion_finset_le`.

The pigeonhole consequence, that some piece of a finite cover carries at least the average of the
integral over the covered set, is `MeasureTheory.exists_card_inv_mul_setLIntegral_le` in
`Kakeya.Pigeonhole`, where the general pigeonholing lemmas are collected.

/-- **Subadditivity of the lower integral over a finite union**.

This is `MeasureTheory.measure_biUnion_finset_le` with the measure of a set replaced by the lower
integral over it. Neither measurability of `f` or of the `A c`, nor disjointness of the `A c`, is
required. -/

/-! ### Covers and bounded overlap

Two facts about a finite family of subsets of a measure space: the trivial direction of a cover,
and the whole content of a bounded-overlap hypothesis. Neither mentions a metric; both are used by
the ball refinement of Step 5 of the factoring construction. -/
