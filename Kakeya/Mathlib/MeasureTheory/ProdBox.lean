# Centred boxes in an `L²` product

The parameter space of `Kakeya.Tube.Dilate` is the `L²` product `ℝ × F₁ × F₂` of a line and two
copies of the transverse hyperplane of a tube, and the region in which the tube parameters live
is a centred box `[-h₀, h₀] × B̄(0, h₁) × B̄(0, h₂)` in it.  This file defines that box
(`Metric.prodBox`) and computes its volume as a product of three factors.

## Blueprint correspondence

The blueprint source is the tube-counting argument.

* `Metric.volume_preimage_ofLp_closedBall_prod` ↔ `lem:prodClosedBallVolume`;
* `Metric.volume_prodBox` ↔ `lem:prodBoxVolume`.
