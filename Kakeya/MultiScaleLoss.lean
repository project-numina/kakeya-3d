# The subpolynomial losses of the `⌈log log 1/δ⌉`-grid dichotomy

The two losses carried by GWZ Lemma 7.7 (`Kakeya/MultiScaleFac.lean`), and the statement that each
is subpolynomial.  Writing `L = log 1/δ`, so that `ssfGridLen δ ≈ log L`:

* `gridLoss = e^{O((log L)^3)}` accumulates one re-uniformization per *pair* of grid levels;
* `scaleGapLoss = e^{c L / log L}` is the cost of one transport across a grid gap.

Neither bounds the other, so both are carried, as `totalLoss`.  They are displayed rather than
converted into a power `δ^{-α}` so that the smallness threshold depends only on the dichotomy's own
parameters, each consumer absorbing a loss at the accuracy it can afford by the three
`exists_threshold_…` lemmas below.

/-! ### The accumulated per-level loss -/

/-- **The loss accumulated by one re-uniformization per grid level**, on the grid of length
`ssfGridLen δ = ⌈log log 1/δ⌉`.

The base `A` and the polylogarithmic exponent `K` are quantified before `δ`; only the exponents
built from `ssfGridLen δ + 1`, the number of levels, are functions of `δ`.  The expression is
subpolynomial (`exists_threshold_gridLoss_le`) but is left displayed, so that a consumer may absorb
it at whatever accuracy it can afford.

The polylogarithmic factor carries the *square* of the number of levels.  A homogenizing pass that
brackets a quantity attached to a single grid level performs one pigeonhole per level and needs only
`K (M + 1)`; a pass that brackets a quantity attached to a *pair* of levels, as the third bullet of
alternative (ii) requires on both halves of Lemma 7.7, performs one pigeonhole per pair and needs
`K (M + 1)^2`.  There is no way to charge the extra factor elsewhere: `A` and `K` are quantified
before `δ`, so neither can absorb a factor growing with `δ`, and `scaleGapLoss` is a different
shape.
Enlarging the exponent is safe for every consumer, `gridLoss` occurring only on the greater side of
upper bounds, and costs nothing asymptotically: the logarithm of the whole expression is
`O((log log 1/δ)^3)`, still `o(log 1/δ)`. -/
noncomputable def gridLoss (A : ℝ≥0) (K : ℕ) (δ : ℝ≥0) : ℝ :=
  (A : ℝ) ^ (ssfGridLen δ + 1) * (1 - Real.log (δ : ℝ)) ^ (K * (ssfGridLen δ + 1) ^ 2)

/-- **The loss of one transport across a grid gap.**

Comparing a Frostman constant at a real scale with the one at the neighbouring grid scale costs the
ratio of two consecutive grid scales raised to a dimensional power, that is `δ^{-c/⌈log log 1/δ⌉}`.

This is *not* dominated by `gridLoss`, and the two must therefore be carried separately: writing
`L = log 1/δ`, so that `ssfGridLen δ ≈ log L`, one has `gridLoss = e^{O((log L)^3)}` whereas
`scaleGapLoss = e^{c L / log L}`, and `L / log L` dwarfs `(log L)^3`.  Both are subpolynomial, which
is all a consumer needs, but neither bounds the other. -/
noncomputable def scaleGapLoss (c : ℕ) (δ : ℝ≥0) : ℝ :=
  (δ : ℝ) ^ (-((c : ℝ) / (ssfGridLen δ : ℝ)))

/-- **The two losses together.**  Used in every conclusion of
`StickyKakeya.dividingScalesFrostman`, so that one symbol covers both the per-level
re-uniformizations and the transports across grid gaps.  Valued in `ENNReal`, the type in which
those conclusions are stated, so that no consumer has to wrap it in `ENNReal.ofReal`. -/

/-- **A cube of a logarithm is eventually dominated by a linear function.**

This is the analytic input behind the subpolynomiality of `gridLoss`.  The grid length is
`⌈log log 1/δ⌉`, so with `L = log 1/δ` the exponent `K (ssfGridLen δ + 1)^2` contributes a *cube* of
`log L` to the logarithm of the loss, to be compared with the linear `α L` on the other side.  An
absorption linear in the grid length would not be strong enough. -/
