# The core-segment parameter of a point of a tube

`Tube.exists_param_of_mem_carrier` unpacks `Tube.carrier_eq`: a point of a `δ`-tube lies within
`δ` of the point of the core segment at some signed distance `t ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]` from the
midpoint. This is the only fact about membership in a tube that the bush bound
(`Kakeya/Tube/CommonPoint.lean` and `Kakeya/DimensionThree/BushCount.lean`) uses.
