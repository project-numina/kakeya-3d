# Normalizing a coarse tube to the unit ball

The bootstrapping step of GWZ Main Lemma 1 replaces a family of `τ`-tubes contained
in one fixed `θ`-tube `T_θ` by a family of bodies of thickness `τ / θ` living in a
ball of bounded radius.  This is *not* `Tube.rescale`, which re-thickens a tube in
place and does not move the ambient ball.  The correct map is the **anisotropic
normalization of `T_θ`**: it is the identity along the core direction of `T_θ` and
dilates the orthogonal complement of that direction by `θ⁻¹`.

Writing `[x, y]` for the core segment of `T_θ`, `e = y - x` (a unit vector), `π` for
the orthogonal projection onto `ℝ ∙ e` and `π⊥ = id - π`, the map is

```
Φ_{T_θ} (z) = x + π (z - x) + θ⁻¹ • π⊥ (z - x).
```

This file supplies `Tube.normalization` (the map), `Tube.normalization.C` (its
distortion constant), `Tube.normalization_distortion` (the geometric estimate),
`ShadedTube.normalizeInto` (the induced operation on shaded tubes) and
`ShadedTube.normalizeInto_transport` (invariance of all the ratio-of-volume
quantities along it).

It also supplies the companion step that turns bodies comparable to tubes back into
honest tubes, `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement` with its selection constant
`Tube.comparableReplacement.C`.

## Blueprint correspondence

Each of the three main lemmas states its conclusion as a `Prop`-valued structure whose
fields are the numbered items of the corresponding blueprint lemma, so that a downstream
argument can quote one item instead of projecting out of a nested conjunction.

* `Tube.normalization.C` ↔ `def:tubeNormalizationConstant`: value `2 ^ (n + 3)`.
* `Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion` ↔ `lem:tubeNormalizationDistortion`:
  `one_le_dist`, `dist_le_C` ↔ (i); `image_subset_cthickening` ↔ (ii);
  `exists_subsegment` ↔ (iii); `image_ambient_subset_closedBall` ↔ (iv).
* `ShadedTube.IsNormalizeIntoTransport` ↔ `lem:tubeNormalizationTransport`:
  `card` ↔ (i); `multiplicity` ↔ (ii); `fullness` ↔ (iii);
  `densityIn`, `maxDensity` ↔ (iv); `frostmanConstIn` ↔ (v);
  `essentiallyDistinct` ↔ (vi).
* `Tube.comparableReplacement.C` ↔ `def:comparableBodiesToTubesConstant`:
  value `1 + 2 * C * C_n`.
* `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate.thin_absorbed` ↔ `lem:essDistinctTubesInThinDilateAbsorbed`
  and `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate.fat_absorbed` ↔ `lem:essDistinctTubesInFatDilateAbsorbed`:
  the two regimes of the packing count are produced in `Kakeya/Tube/Dilate.lean`
  (`Tube.essDistinctTubesInThinDilate`, `Tube.essDistinctTubesInFatDilate`) and absorbed into
  `Tube.comparableReplacement.C` here, where that constant is defined.
* `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate` ↔ `lem:essDistinctTubesInDilate`.
* `Tube.IsComparableReplacement` ↔ `lem:comparableBodiesToTubes`:
  `multiplicity` ↔ (i); `fullness` ↔ (ii); `frostmanConstIn` ↔ (iii);
  `select` ↔ (iv) and (v), bundled since they share the witness `s'`.
* `Tube.rescaleMap` ↔ `def:tubeRescale`: the normalization followed by the homothety
  `z ↦ (z - T₀.x) / (4 R)`.  The blueprint records the target `Tube.rescale`, which is
  already taken by the unrelated re-thickening operation of `Kakeya/Tube/Basic.lean`.
* `Tube.IsRescalingSituation` ↔ the standing hypotheses that
  the rescaling and selection argument names *the rescaling situation*.
* `Tube.centredExtension` ↔ `def:centredExtensionTube`.
* `Tube.cthickening_subset_centredExtension`, `Tube.centredExtension_subset_closedBall`,
  `Tube.center_centredExtension` and `Tube.direction_centredExtension` ↔
  `lem:centredExtensionProperties` (i), (ii), (iii); item (iii) asserts two independent
  equalities and is therefore two Lean lemmas rather than one conjunction.
* `Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image` ↔ `lem:rescaleImageVolumeRatio`,
  at the general dimension and with the dimensional factor `κ(n)` explicit.
* `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` ↔ `lem:coreOuterTube`, whose four hypotheses (a)–(d) are the
  distortion package, so it is stated with `Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion` in their place.
  Its volume clause is the `n = 3` clause of the blueprint lemma and is stated under
  `Module.finrank ℝ E = 3`: the numeral `(4 R) ^ 6` is **not** the general-`n` bound
  `(4 R) ^ (2 n)`, which is false — see the statement.

* `Tube.rescaleMap_apply`, `Tube.rescaleMap_apply_x`: the metric layer of `Tube.rescaleMap`.
* `Tube.rescale_symm_apply_add_smul` ↔ `lem:rescalePullbackAxis`,
  `Tube.norm_rescale_symm_vector_le` ↔ `lem:rescalePullbackVector` and
  `Tube.preimage_rescale_dilate_subset_dilate` ↔ `lem:rescalePullbackDilate`: the three
  pullbacks of the downstairs selection.  All three are stated *forwards*, in terms of
  `Tube.rescaleMap` rather than of an affine equivalence `Ψ⁻¹`; see the section docstring
  there for why, and why the forward forms are equivalent and not weaker.
* `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C` ↔ `def:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilateConstant` and
  `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate` ↔ `lem:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate`, the single **open
  leaf** of that route.

* `Tube.card_le_mul_card_of_dilateCover_affine` ↔ `lem:comparableAffineFibreBound` and
  `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement_affine` ↔ `lem:comparableAffineImagesToTubes`, the two
  lemmas of the affine fibre-counting argument built on that leaf: the affine substitutes for
  `Tube.card_le_mul_card_of_dilateCover` and `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement` on the
  fine-normalization route.  Their conclusion bundle is `Tube.IsComparableReplacementFree`,
  which is `Tube.IsComparableReplacement` at a free selection constant, and the refinement
  clause is cited at that free constant as `Tube.isCRefinement_of_card_le_free` ↔
  `lem:comparableRefinementClauseFree`.  Both are proved *modulo* the open leaf above and
  nothing else.

`lem:rescaleImageVolumeRatio` and `lem:coreOuterTube` are still not stated here; see the
section docstring in the middle of this file for what they need.

Two entries deviate deliberately from the informal wording, in each case strengthening or
correcting it; both deviations are documented at the structure they occur in.
`IsNormalizationDistortion` states (ii) and (iii) with `Metric.cthickening` of a segment
in place of "is contained in / contains a tube" — see the next section, and blueprint
`note:tubeNormalizationNotTubes`.  `IsNormalizeIntoTransport` states (iii) as an equality
rather than a two-sided comparison, and quantifies (iv), (v) over *every* convex body.

## Divergence from the informal statement

The blueprint (the normalization argument,
`lem:tubeNormalizationDistortion`) asserts that `Φ_{T_θ} (T)` is *contained in a
`C (τ/θ)`-tube* and *contains a `C⁻¹ (τ/θ)`-tube*.  Both halves are false for the
`Tube` structure of this development, because a `Tube` has a core segment of length
**exactly one**:

* `Φ_{T_θ}` is the identity along `e` and expands `e^⊥` by `θ⁻¹ ≥ 1`, so it
  *lengthens* core segments.  Quantitatively, if `T ⊆ T_θ` is a `τ`-tube with unit
  core direction `f`, then `f = c • e + g` with `g ⊥ e` and `‖g‖ ≤ 2 θ`, so the
  image core has length `√(c² + θ⁻²‖g‖²) ∈ [1, √5]`.  A set whose core has length
  `> 1 + O(ρ)` is not contained in any `ρ`-tube for small `ρ`.
* Symmetrically, a `ρ`-tube is the closed `ρ`-neighbourhood of a *unit* segment, so
  its end caps stick out by `ρ` beyond the core; the image `Φ_{T_θ} (T)` only sticks
  out by `τ = θ ρ ≪ ρ` beyond its own core, so it contains no `C⁻¹ ρ`-tube either
  (take `f = e`, where the image core has length exactly one and there is no slack).

What is true — and what the informal proof actually establishes — is the same
two-sided estimate with `ρ`-tubes replaced by closed `ρ`-neighbourhoods of segments
of length comparable to one (`Metric.cthickening ρ (segment ℝ a b)`, which is the
carrier of a tube by `Tube.carrier_eq_cthickening` exactly when `dist a b = 1`).
`Tube.normalization_distortion` is stated in that form.  Passing from there to
honest `τ/θ`-tubes is a separate step, with a bounded loss; in the blueprint it is
`lem:comparableBodiesToTubes` (the tube-counting argument), formalized below as
`Tube.exists_comparableReplacement`.  That step needs *two-sided* comparability — an inner
tube inside each body as well as an outer one — see the docstring there and blueprint
`note:comparableBodiesGap`.

The transport lemma `ShadedTube.normalizeInto_transport` is unaffected by this: it
concerns only ratios of volumes along the affine bijection `Φ_{T_θ}`, and needs
neither `τ ≤ θ` nor `T_i ⊆ T_θ`.  Its fullness clause is an *equality*, not the
two-sided comparison of the informal statement: the normalized family consists of
the images `Φ_{T_θ}(T_i)` themselves, not of honest tubes replacing them, so the
constant Jacobian of `Φ_{T_θ}` cancels exactly.

  /-- (iii) `Φ_{T₀}(T)` contains the closed `C⁻¹ ρ`-neighbourhood of a sub-segment of the
  image core `[a, b]` of length at least `7/8`; taking the sub-segment inside `[a, b]` is
  what makes it "a segment with the same direction as `[a, b]`".

  The length `7/8 = 1 - 2 * (1/16)` is the strongest this route delivers, and *unit* length is
  **false** (module docstring, blueprint `note:tubeNormalizationNotTubes`): the trimming
  parameter is `lam = C⁻¹ ρ ≤ 1/16`, so the sub-segment has length `1 - 2 lam ≥ 7/8`, and one
  cannot take `lam = 0`.  Indeed `Φ_{T₀}(T)` protrudes beyond `[a', b']` by only `τ = θ ρ`,
  whereas the `C⁻¹ ρ`-neighbourhood of a *unit* sub-segment must protrude by `C⁻¹ ρ`; and when
  the core of `T` is parallel to the axis of `T₀` one has `dist a' b' = 1` exactly, so a unit
  sub-segment is the whole of `[a', b']` and there is no interior slack to take up.  The
  unit-length reading therefore forces `τ ≥ C⁻¹`, which fails in the whole regime of interest.
  The radius of the neighbourhood stays `C⁻¹ ρ`; only the length is strengthened. -/

/-! ### The metric layer behind `Tube.normalization_distortion`

Everything in `Tube.normalization_distortion` rests on one computation,
`Tube.norm_sq_normalization_sub`: writing `e = T.direction` and `u = z - w`,

```
‖Φ z - Φ w‖² = ⟪e, u⟫² + θ⁻² ‖u - ⟪e, u⟫ • e‖².
```

The parallel component is untouched and the perpendicular one is multiplied by `θ⁻¹ ≥ 1`.
The lemmas below record that identity, its two immediate consequences (`Φ` never shortens
and is `θ⁻¹`-Lipschitz), and the one geometric input coming from `T ⊆ T₀`, namely that a
point of a `θ`-tube is within `θ` of its core axis. -/

/-! ### The four items of `Tube.normalization_distortion`, one lemma each

The blueprint proves the four items of `lem:tubeNormalizationDistortion` separately, each from
the metric layer above, and the lemma itself is their conjunction.  Throughout the statements
below (the blueprint's "standing situation") `T₀` is a `θ`-tube with core `[x, y]` and unit
direction `e = T₀.direction`, `T ⊆ T₀` is a `τ`-tube with core `[a, b]` and unit direction
`f = T.direction`, `Φ = Tube.normalization T₀`, `ρ = τ / θ` and
`C = Tube.normalization.C n = 2 ^ (n + 3) ≥ 16`; for `d : E` the perpendicular component is
written `d - ⟪e, d⟫ • e`. -/

/-- **Endpoints of the inner core, and its perpendicular spread**.

The endpoints of the core of `T` lie in `T` (`Tube.x_mem_carrier`, `Tube.y_mem_carrier`), hence
in `T₀`; applying `Tube.perp_norm_le_of_mem_carrier` at each and subtracting bounds the
perpendicular component of `a - b` — equivalently of the direction `f` — by `2 θ`.  This is what
makes the image core short: the component that `Φ` stretches by `θ⁻¹` is itself only `O(θ)`. -/

/-- **Endpoints of the inner core, and its perpendicular spread, over a dilate**.

This is the dilate analogue of `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset`: the containment
`T ⊆ T₀` is weakened to `T ⊆ c · T₀`, and the perpendicular spread `2 θ` becomes `2 c θ`.

It is a two-line corollary of an estimate that is already available:
`Kakeya.Tube.norm_chord_transverse_le_of_endpoints_mem_dilate` bounds the transverse part of
a *unit chord* of a dilate, and the core of `T` is such a chord — its endpoints lie in `T`
(`Tube.x_mem_carrier`, `Tube.y_mem_carrier`), hence in `c · T₀`, and `dist T.x T.y = 1`
(`Tube.dist_eq_one`).  No separate argument through
`Tube.abs_inner_and_perp_le_of_mem_dilate` is needed.

At `c = 1` this is `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset` again.  At `c = 2` the bound is
`4 θ`, which is the tilt bound of `lem:ml1bootFineNormalizeCore` at `κ = 4`, the largest
value that lemma admits: since `‖T.x - T.y‖ = 1` (`Tube.dist_eq_one`), the left-hand side is
exactly the sine of the angle between the core of `T` and the axis `T₀.direction`, so the
statement says that a `τ`-tube inside `2 · T₀` is tilted against the axis of `T₀` by at most
`4 θ`. -/

This is the anisotropic replacement for "`Φ⁻¹` is `1`-Lipschitz": both summands of

most `r` but the perpendicular one at most `θ r`, smaller by a factor `θ`.  The plain

/-- **The shift estimate at a free tilt bound**.

`Tube.dist_add_smul_direction_segment_le` with the containment `T ⊆ T₀` replaced by the one
consequence of it that the proof uses: a bound `B` on the transverse part of `T.direction`
against the axis of `T₀`.  The conclusion is the same estimate with `2 θ` replaced by `B`.

The containment enters that lemma only through
`Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset`, which gives `B = 2 θ`; the dilate containment
`T ⊆ c · T₀` gives `B = 2 c θ` by `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset_dilate`, and every
consumer of the trimmed-core geometry is an instance of this one lemma at the appropriate `B`.
Both instances are recorded below. -/

/-- **Pointwise containment near the trimmed image core**.

Unlike `Tube.normalization_trimmed_core`, here the trimming parameter must be exactly
`lam = C⁻¹ ρ`: the proof turns `θ · lam` into `C⁻¹ τ`, and adds the two errors `2 C⁻¹ τ` (from
`Tube.dist_add_smul_direction_segment_le`) and `C⁻¹ τ` (from
`Tube.abs_inner_and_perp_le_of_dist_normalization_le`) to get `3 C⁻¹ τ ≤ τ`. -/

/-- **The normalization distorts tubes by a bounded factor** (GWZ, the estimate behind
Equation (multTildeT); blueprint `lem:tubeNormalizationDistortion`).

Let `0 < τ ≤ θ ≤ 1`, let `T₀` be a `θ`-tube and let `T ⊆ T₀` be a `τ`-tube.  Then all four
items of the blueprint lemma hold; they are packaged as the fields of
`Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion`.

The blueprint's standing assumption is `0 < τ ≤ θ ≤ 1`, but only `0 < θ` is used: it is
what makes `Tube.normalization T₀` the intended invertible map rather than the orthogonal
projection onto the core axis (recall `(0 : ℝ)⁻¹ = 0` in Lean).  It is therefore `hθ` that
is assumed here; `0 < τ` is not needed, and the degenerate case `τ = 0` is still true, with
`T.carrier` the unit core segment and `ρ = 0`.  At the call sites `0 < τ ≤ θ` is always
available, so `hθ` costs nothing. -/

`fun i => (𝕋 i).normalizeInto T₀ hθ`; the index set is unchanged, and the result is a

/-- **The conclusions of `ShadedTube.normalizeInto_transport`, one field per item.**

Every quantity of the argument that is a *ratio* of volumes is unchanged when a shaded
family of `τ`-tubes inside a `θ`-tube `T₀` is replaced by its normalization, because
`Tube.normalization T₀` is an affine bijection with constant Jacobian
(`Tube.volume_image_normalization`).  The fields are the items (i)–(vi) of the blueprint
lemma `lem:tubeNormalizationTransport`, with item (iv) split into its two halves
`densityIn` and `maxDensity`; they are named rather than bundled into a nested
conjunction so that a downstream argument can quote a single item.

The fullness clause `fullness` is an equality rather than the two-sided comparison of the
informal statement, and `densityIn`, `maxDensity`, `frostmanConstIn` hold for *every*
convex body `K`, not only for `K ⊆ T₀`: both strengthenings come for free from `Φ_{T₀}`
being an affine bijection with constant Jacobian.  Correspondingly the hypotheses
`τ ≤ θ` and `T i ⊆ T₀` of the blueprint are not needed here; they belong to
`Tube.normalization_distortion`. -/

The two summands are the two regimes of the packing count `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate`: the
first is the count in the `(2n-1)`-dimensional parameter space of `Tube.parameterMap`, the
second the crude ball count of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInFatDilate`.  Here
`ω_d = 2 ^ d · Metric.coveringNumber_mul_pow_le_volume_cthickening.C d` is the volume of the
unit ball of `ℝ ^ d`, and the blueprint's packing constant
`C_{lem:separatedSetCardBound}(d) = 2 ^ d / ω_d` is the inverse of that same abbreviation.

`Tube.exists_comparableReplacement`:

```
C_{lem:comparableBodiesToTubes}(n, C) = 1 + K_∗(n) C ^ (2n) C_n ^ (4n).
```

It depends only on the ambient dimension `n`, on the comparability constant `C` of that
lemma, and on the linear dilation constant `C_n = Kakeya.Tube.tubeOverlapCoreClose.C n`; it
does *not* depend on the scale `ρ`, on the family, or on the shading.  It serves both as the
selection constant of that lemma and as the packing bound of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate`.
The additive `1` makes `1 ≤ Tube.comparableReplacement.C n C` hold unconditionally.

The degrees cannot be lowered much: for `n = 3`, `C = 1`, the dilate `C_n · V` has core length
`≈ C_n` and thickness `≈ C_n ρ`, hence contains `≈ C_n` axial by `≈ C_n²` perpendicular
translates of pairwise essentially distinct `ρ`-tubes, so no bound of size `O(C_n)` holds.

Two earlier values were too small and made `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate` false:
`1 + 2 C · Kakeya.Tube.overlapContainment.C n`, which is linear in the dilation factor and uses
a *volume* ratio in place of the *linear* factor `C_n`, and `1 + 2 ^ (n+3) C ^ (2n) C_n ^ (2n+1)`,
whose leading factor cannot absorb the `(32 n) ^ (2n-1)` of the thin regime and whose exponent
`2n + 1` is below the degree `4n` of the fat regime. -/

K'(n) = 6 ^ (2n) C_{lem:essDistinctTubeCount}(n),
```
one has `K(n) + K'(n) = K_∗(n) = Tube.comparableReplacement.Kstar n`, and the two products
`K(n) C ^ (2n-1) C_n ^ (2n)` (the thin regime) and `K'(n) C ^ (2n) C_n ^ (4n)` (the fat regime)
are both at most `Tube.comparableReplacement.C n C`.  With `c_∗ = 1 / (4n)` the factor
`(c_∗/4) ^ -(2n-1)` is `(16 n) ^ (2n-1)`.

/-- **Absorbing the thin bound into the selection constant**.

The hypothesis is verbatim the conclusion of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInThinDilate`
(`Kakeya/Tube/Dilate.lean`); this lemma only identifies its right-hand side.  With
`r = c_∗ σ / 4 = σ / (16 n)` one has `r ^ -(2n-1) = (16 n) ^ (2n-1) σ ^ -(2n-1)`, and
`σ ^ -(2n-1) · σ · ρ ^ (2n-2) = (ρ / σ) ^ (2n-2) = C ^ (2n-2)` because `σ = C⁻¹ ρ`, so the
right-hand side is `K(n) C ^ (2n-1) C_n ^ (2n)` — the left-hand side of the first conjunct of
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate.constant_bounds`.

It is stated for an arbitrary `N : ENNReal` rather than for a cardinality: nothing about a
family survives into the arithmetic, and the two regimes then compose by `le_trans`.  No upper
bound on `ρ` is assumed — the powers of `ρ` cancel identically — but `0 < ρ` is needed, since at
`ρ = 0` the second factor is `∞`. -/

/-- **Essentially distinct thin tubes trapped in a dilate of a fat tube**.

Let `V` be a `ρ`-tube and let `C_n = C_{lem:tubeOverlapCoreClose}` be the dilation factor
produced by `Kakeya.Tube.tubeOverlapCoreClose`.  A family of pairwise essentially distinct
`C⁻¹ ρ`-tubes all contained in the dilate `C_n · V` has at most
`C_{lem:comparableBodiesToTubes}(n, C)` members, a bound independent of `ρ`, of `V` and of the
family.

This is the packing input of `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement`, and the only place where the
inner tubes of that lemma are used.  The dilate is written as `Kakeya.Tube.dilate V C_n`, the
concrete convex body that `Kakeya.Tube.overlapContainment` produces, rather than as an abstract
body of comparable volume: the counting argument needs its shape, not only its volume.

The proof is the case split of blueprint `note:essDistinctTubesInDilateRegimes` on the size of
`ρ` against `1 / (4 C_n)`, each branch being one count followed by one absorption:
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInThinDilate` then `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate.thin_absorbed` in the
thin branch, and `Tube.essDistinctTubesInFatDilate` then
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate.fat_absorbed` in the fat one. -/

/-! ### Transporting the shaded-family quantities to comparable bodies

The five items of `Tube.IsComparableReplacement` split into three that need only the *one-sided*
comparability `W_i ⊆ V_i ⊆ K`, `|V_i| ≤ C |W_i|`
and two that need the inner tubes and the two-sided shade bounds.  The one-sided half is
isolated because `ConvexSpaceBody.frostmanConstIn_ge_of_comparable` also consumes it. -/

`ShadedBody.multiplicity` is built from the shades and their union alone, so this is a
congruence rather than an estimate. -/

Let `C₁ = C_{lem:comparableBodiesToTubes}(n, C)`.  The two-sided shade bounds
`Λ⁻¹ μ₀ W ≤ |Z_i| ≤ Λ μ₀ W` give, in total, `|s| · Λ μ₀ W` as an upper bound on the
sum of the shades over `s` and `|s'| · Λ⁻¹ μ₀ W` as a lower bound on the sum over
`s'`.  Combining these with the cardinality bound `|s| ≤ C₁ |s'|` and the identification
`(C₁ Λ²)⁻¹ = C₁⁻¹ Λ⁻²` in `ENNReal` yields
`(C₁ Λ²)⁻¹ ∑_{i ∈ s} |Z_i| ≤ ∑_{i ∈ s'} |Z_i|`, i.e. the claimed `(C₁ Λ²)⁻¹`-refinement.

/-- **Replacing comparable bodies by honest `ρ`-tubes**.

Let `𝕎 = (W_i)_{i ∈ s}` be a nonempty family of pairwise essentially distinct convex bodies
of common volume `W > 0`, all contained in a convex body `K` of positive volume, shaded by
`Z_i = (𝕎 i).shade` with `Λ⁻¹ μ₀ W ≤ |Z_i| ≤ Λ μ₀ W`.  Suppose each `W_i` is *two-sidedly*
comparable to a tube: there are a `ρ`-tube `V_i` and a `C⁻¹ ρ`-tube `U_i` with

```
U_i ⊆ W_i ⊆ V_i ⊆ K,      |V_i| ≤ C |W_i|,
```

that `V_i` carries the same shading `Z_i`, and that the *inner* tubes `(U_i)_{i ∈ s}` are
pairwise essentially distinct.  Then all five items of `Tube.IsComparableReplacement` hold.

The inner tubes enter only through the selection item `select`, via
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate`; the fields `multiplicity`, `fullness` and `frostmanConstIn`
are proved from `W_i ⊆ V_i` and `|V_i| ≤ C |W_i|` alone.  Blueprint
`note:comparableBodiesGap` records why the selection item is *not* available from that
one-sided data: it would require bounding the number of pairwise essentially distinct bodies
of volume `W` inside a body of volume `≲ C W`, and the only counting tools in the development
(`lem:tubesInBodyCount`, which is a Katz–Tao bound, and the naive `L²` count) both fail at
the constants needed here. The inner tubes are therefore necessary.

The `ρ`-tubes are supplied as a family of `ShadedTube ρ E` rather than as bare tubes plus a
separate shading: the containment `Z_i ⊆ W_i ⊆ V_i` that makes `Z` a shading of `𝕍` is then
part of the type, and the conclusions can be stated with the existing `ShadedBody` API.  The
inner tubes carry no shading and are supplied as bare `Tube (C⁻¹ * ρ) E`. -/

/-! ### The rescaling of a tube at a normalized ambient radius

The rescaling and selection argument calls the situation below *the rescaling
situation*; the declarations of this section are that situation, the centred extension it produces, the
three pullbacks of the downstairs selection and the count they feed
(`lem:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate`, the open leaf of that route).

Notation, translated into the naming convention of this file: the blueprint's ambient
`τ`-tube `T_τ` with initial core endpoint `x` is `T₀ : Tube θ E` with `x = T₀.x`; the
blueprint's inner `δ`-tube `T` is `T : Tube τ E`; the blueprint's `ρ = δ / τ` is
`(τ : ℝ) / (θ : ℝ)`; the blueprint's output scale `σ ∈ (0, 1/4]` with `σ ≤ ρ` is `σ : NNReal`;
`C_N = Tube.normalization.C n` and the normalized ambient radius satisfies `C_N ≤ R`.  The
blueprint's `Φ = Φ_{T_τ}` is `T₀.normalization` and its `Ψ = h ∘ Φ` is `T₀.rescaleMap R`.

The scale hypotheses `0 < θ`, `τ ≤ θ`, `θ ≤ 1`, `0 < σ`, `σ ≤ 1/4`, `σ ≤ ρ`, `C_N ≤ R` are
exactly that standing situation, so they travel bundled, as `Tube.IsRescalingSituation`.  The
extra hypothesis `ρ ≤ 4 σ` of the outer-tube lemma is *not* part of it — it is what that one
lemma adds — and is spelled out there. -/

/-- **The rescaling situation** (the rescaling and selection argument, the standing
hypotheses of that subsubsection).

`IsRescalingSituation θ τ σ R n` collects the scale hypotheses under which the rescaling
`Tube.rescaleMap` of an ambient `θ`-tube at radius `R` carries an inner `τ`-tube to a body
comparable to a `σ`-tube in the unit ball, in dimension `n`: the ambient scale `θ` is a
genuine tube scale (`pos_ambient`, `ambient_le_one`) containing the inner scale
(`inner_le_ambient`), the output scale `σ` is positive, truncated at `1/4` and no larger than
the ratio `ρ = τ / θ`, and the ambient radius is past the distortion constant
`C_N = Tube.normalization.C n`.

These seven inequalities are one mathematical situation and not an incidental list, which is
why they are a structure: every statement about the rescaling needs all of them, the
blueprint names the package, and `Tube.rescale_outer_tube` would otherwise open with nine
hypothesis binders.  What is deliberately *not* in it is the extra inequality `ρ ≤ 4 σ` used
by `Tube.rescale_outer_tube`; that one belongs to that lemma alone, and is what forces the
homothety ratio `4 R` rather than `R`.

The dimension is a bare `n : ℕ` rather than `Module.finrank ℝ E` so that the structure carries
no typeclass baggage; consumers instantiate it at `n = Module.finrank ℝ E`. -/
structure IsRescalingSituation (θ τ σ : ℝ≥0) (R : ℝ) (n : ℕ) : Prop where
  /-- The ambient tube scale is positive. -/

  /-- The inner tube scale does not exceed the ambient one, so `ρ = τ / θ ≤ 1`. -/

  /-- The ambient tube scale is a scale, `θ ≤ 1`; this is what makes `Φ_{T₀}` expanding. -/

/-- **The rescaling of a `θ`-tube at a normalized ambient radius `R`**: the normalization `Φ_{T₀}`
of `Tube.normalization` followed by the
homothety `h : z ↦ (z - T₀.x) / (4 R)` about the initial endpoint `T₀.x` of the core, that is

```
Ψ_{T₀,R} (z) = (4 R)⁻¹ • (Φ_{T₀} (z) - T₀.x).
```

Recentring at `T₀.x` rather than dividing by `4 R` outright is what makes
`Ψ (B̄(T₀.x, R)) = B̄(0, 1/4)` exact rather than exact up to a translation, and it is why
`Ψ_{T₀,R} (T₀.x) = 0` (`Tube.normalization_apply_x`).  For `0 < θ` and `0 < R` the map is
an affine equivalence, its linear part being `(4 R)⁻¹ • A` with `A` the linear part of
`Φ_{T₀}` (`Tube.normalizationLinear`): the identity on `ℝ ∙ T₀.direction` and multiplication
by `θ⁻¹` on its orthogonal complement.  Consequently the linear part of `Ψ⁻¹` is `4 R • A⁻¹`,
which is multiplication by `4 R` on `ℝ ∙ T₀.direction` and by `4 R θ` on its orthogonal
complement.

The name is `rescaleMap` and not `rescale` because `Tube.rescale` of `Kakeya/Tube/Basic.lean`
is an unrelated operation — it re-thickens a tube in place, keeping its core — while this is
a map of the ambient space.  The blueprint records the Lean target as `Tube.rescale`; that
target is unavailable and the blueprint should be corrected to `Tube.rescaleMap`. -/

/-- **The `s`-tube on the centred unit extension of a segment**.

For `p ≠ q` and `s : NNReal`, `Tube.centredExtension s hpq` is the `s`-tube whose core is the
segment of length `1` centred at `midpoint ℝ p q` in the direction `g = (q - p) / ‖q - p‖`,
namely `[midpoint ℝ p q - g / 2, midpoint ℝ p q + g / 2]`.  Its carrier is the closed
`s`-neighbourhood of that core (`Tube.carrier_eq_cthickening`).

This is the "extension to unit length" that the proof of blueprint
`lem:ml1bootFineNormalizeCore` takes at `p = Ψ(a)`, `q = Ψ(b)` for the images of the
endpoints of the core of an inner tube: an honest `Tube` has a core of length exactly `1`
(`Tube.dist_eq_one`), whereas `Ψ` shortens the image core by the factor `4 R`, so the core
has to be extended rather than used as it stands.  The hypothesis `p ≠ q` is what makes the
direction `g` a unit vector and hence the construction legitimate.

The four properties it is used for are separated out as
`Tube.cthickening_subset_centredExtension`, `Tube.centredExtension_subset_closedBall`,
`Tube.center_centredExtension` and `Tube.direction_centredExtension`.

Formally this is nothing but `Tube.ofMidpointDirection` — the tube with prescribed midpoint and
unit direction of `Kakeya/Tube/Basic.lean` — read at `m = midpoint ℝ p q` and `u = g`; the only
work is checking `‖g‖ = 1`, which is where `p ≠ q` is spent.  Consequently the two `@[simps!]`
lemmas `Tube.ofMidpointDirection_x` and `Tube.ofMidpointDirection_y` compute the core endpoints
of a `centredExtension`, and no separate simp set is needed. -/

`lem:centredExtensionProperties`\ `item:centredExtCover`).

If `dist p q ≤ 1` then `[p, q]` is contained in the core of `Tube.centredExtension s hpq`,
because both segments are centred at `midpoint ℝ p q` and point in the same direction `g`,
the first having half-length `dist p q / 2 ≤ 1/2` and the second half-length `1/2`;
neighbourhoods of the same radius are then nested (`Metric.cthickening_subset_of_subset`,
after `Tube.carrier_eq_cthickening`).

The intended route: parametrise `[p, q] = {midpoint ℝ p q + t • g : |t| ≤ dist p q / 2}` and
cite `Tube.midpoint_add_smul_direction_mem_segment` for the resulting membership in the
core. -/

/-! ### Volume and containment in the rescaling situation

The following estimates correspond to `lem:rescaleImageVolumeRatio` and `lem:coreOuterTube`
in the fine-normalization argument.

**The outer tube is volume-comparable to the rescaled image**.

In the rescaling situation, suppose `Φ_{T₀}(T)` contains the closed `C_N⁻¹ ρ`-neighbourhood
of *some* segment `[p, q]` of length `ℓ ∈ (0, 1]`, and write `V = ext_σ[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` and
`W = Ψ(T)`.  Then

```
|V| ≤ (C_{Tube.volume_le}(n) / c_{Tube.le_volume}(n)) * ℓ⁻¹ * C_N ^ (n-1) * (4 R) ^ n * |W|.
```

The intended route is two volume estimates and one cancellation.  Upper bound: `V` is a
`σ`-tube with `σ ≤ 1`, so `Tube.volume_le` gives `|V| ≤ C_{volume_le}(n) σ ^ (n-1)`.  Lower
bound: the homothety `h : z ↦ (z - T₀.x) / (4 R)` of `Tube.rescaleMap` divides every distance
by `4 R`, so `W = h(Φ_{T₀}(T))` contains the closed `r̂`-neighbourhood of a segment of length
`ℓ̂`, with `r̂ = C_N⁻¹ ρ / (4 R)` and `ℓ̂ = ℓ / (4 R)`; that neighbourhood is the image of the
carrier of an honest `(r̂ / ℓ̂)`-tube under the homothety of ratio `ℓ̂` about the midpoint of
the segment, so `Tube.le_volume` together with the volume law for an affine image
(`Kakeya.volume_affineImage`, as used in `Tube.volume_image_normalization`) gives
`|W| ≥ c_{le_volume}(n) * ℓ̂ * r̂ ^ (n-1)`.  Dividing and using `σ ≤ ρ` to cancel the powers
of `ρ` leaves the stated factor, the surviving `(σ / ρ) ^ (n-1)` being at most `1`.

At `n = 3` the dimensional ratio is `C_{volume_le}(3) / c_{le_volume}(3) = 36 / π < 12`, so
with `C_N ≤ R` and `ℓ ≥ 7/8` (the length `Tube.normalization_exists_subsegment` delivers) the
whole factor is at most `(4 R) ^ 6`, which is the comparability constant that blueprint
`def:ml1bootFineNormalizeCoreConstant`(iii) is stated at; that numerical step is
`Tube.rescale_outer_tube`, not this lemma, and it is available **only** at `n = 3`: the ratio
`κ(n) = C_{volume_le}(n) / c_{le_volume}(n)` grows like `Γ(n / 2 + 1)`, so it outgrows any
fixed power of `4 R` at the smallest admissible radius `R = C_N`, and the general-`n` reading
`(4 R) ^ (2 n)` of that numerical step is false.

**The outer tube of a rescaled tube**.

In the rescaling situation (`Tube.IsRescalingSituation`) assume in addition `ρ ≤ 4 σ`, that the
distortion package `Tube.IsNormalizationDistortion T₀ T` holds, and that
`Φ_{T₀}(T) ⊆ B̄(T₀.x, R)`.  Write `V = ext_σ[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` and `W = Ψ(T)`.  Then `V` is a
`σ`-tube with

```
W ⊆ V ⊆ B̄(Ψ(T₀.x), 1) = B̄(0, 1),      |V| ≤ (4 R) ^ 6 |W|      (n = 3).
```

Three claims, and the homothety `h : z ↦ (z - T₀.x) / (4 R)` of `Tube.rescaleMap` divides
every distance by `4 R` and sends `T₀.x` to `0`.

*Thickness.*  By `IsNormalizationDistortion.image_subset_cthickening`, `W = h(Φ_{T₀}(T))`
lies in the closed `(C_N ρ / (4 R))`-neighbourhood of `[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]`, and
`C_N ρ / (4 R) ≤ ρ / 4 ≤ σ` by `C_N ≤ R` and the added hypothesis `ρ ≤ 4 σ`.  By
`IsNormalizationDistortion.dist_le_C`, `dist (Ψ T.x) (Ψ T.y) = dist (Φ T.x) (Φ T.y) / (4 R)
≤ C_N / (4 R) ≤ 1/4 ≤ 1`, so `Tube.cthickening_subset_centredExtension` puts the closed
`σ`-neighbourhood of `[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` inside `V`, and hence `W ⊆ V`.  This is the one step
at which the value `4 R` of the homothety ratio is used: at ratio `R` the chain would read
`C_N ρ / R ≤ ρ ≤ σ`, whose second step is false whenever `ρ > 1/4`, that is exactly in the
regime where the output scale `σ = min (ρ, 1/4)` is truncated.

*Position.*  By `hball` and `T.x, T.y ∈ T.carrier`, `Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y) ∈ B̄(0, 1/4)`, and
`σ ≤ 1/4`, so `Tube.centredExtension_subset_closedBall` at `z = 0 = Ψ(T₀.x)` gives
`V ⊆ B̄(0, 1)`.  This is where `σ ≤ 1/4` itself is spent.

*Volume.*  This is `Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image`, whose
hypothesis is `IsNormalizationDistortion.exists_subsegment` read at `ℓ = 7/8`, together with
the numerics recorded there: at `n = 3` the factor is at most
`(36/π) * (8/7) * C_N ^ 2 * (4 R) ^ 3 ≤ (4 R) ^ 6`, using `C_N ≤ R`, and indeed
`C_N (3) = 64`, so `(4 R) ^ 3 ≥ 256 ^ 3` leaves three orders of magnitude of room.

## Why the volume clause is stated at `n = 3`

The hypothesis `hn : Module.finrank ℝ E = 3` is spent on the volume clause only; the two
inclusions hold in every dimension.  It cannot be dropped, because the general-`n` reading
`|V| ≤ (4 R) ^ (2 n) |W|` of that clause is **false**.  Feeding the general estimate
`Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image` at `ℓ = 7/8` and the smallest
admissible radius `R = C_N = 2 ^ (n + 3)` — so `4 R = 2 ^ (n + 5)` — the required inequality
`κ(n) * (8/7) * C_N ^ (n-1) ≤ (4 R) ^ n` reduces, with
`volume_le.C n = 2 ^ (n + 1)` and `le_volume.c n = √π ^ n / Γ(n / 2 + 1) / 3`, to
`Γ(n / 2 + 1) ≤ (7/6) * (4 √π) ^ n`.  The left side is superexponential in `n` and the right
side exponential, so the inequality holds with enormous room at `n = 3`
(`1.33 ≤ 416`) and fails for `n` past roughly `274`.  Since both volume estimates are sharp up
to their dimensional constants, the failure is a failure of the statement, not of the route.
The general-dimension form of this clause is
`Tube.volume_centredExtension_le_mul_volume_rescale_image` itself, with `κ(n)` explicit; the
blueprint likewise claims `(4 R) ^ 6` at `n = 3` only. -/

/-! ### The metric layer of `Tube.rescaleMap`, the three pullbacks and the count

The declarations below are the downstairs-selection route of blueprint
the rescaling and selection argument and the affine fibre-counting argument: two equation
lemmas for `Tube.rescaleMap`, then the three pullbacks `lem:rescalePullbackAxis`,
`lem:rescalePullbackVector`, `lem:rescalePullbackDilate`, then the constant
`def:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilateConstant` and the count `lem:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate`,
which is the single **open leaf** of the route.

## Divergence from the informal statement: the pullbacks are stated forwards

The blueprint writes the first two pullbacks with `Ψ⁻¹`, which presupposes the affine
*equivalence* underlying `Tube.rescaleMap`.  Building that equivalence would make every
statement below carry the two proof terms `0 < θ` and `R ≠ 0` inside the term `Ψ`, and would
make the statements harder to apply, since a consumer holds `Ψ z ∈ …` and not
`z = Ψ⁻¹ …`.  They are therefore stated in the equivalent *forward* form, which mentions only
the affine map `Tube.rescaleMap`:

* `Ψ⁻¹(m̂ + α f̂) = m + α' f` becomes `Ψ(m + α' f) = Ψ m + α f̂`;
* `u = Ψ⁻¹(w + v) - Ψ⁻¹ w` becomes the hypothesis `Ψ (z + u) = Ψ z + v`;
* `Ψ⁻¹(c · V) ⊆ c' · T` becomes `Ψ ⁻¹' (c · V).carrier ⊆ (c' · T).carrier`, which is the same
  set inclusion for a bijective `Ψ` and is what the fibre bound actually uses.

`Tube.rescaleMap` is injective for `0 < θ` and `R ≠ 0` (`Tube.normalization_injective` and the
homothety), so the forward forms are equivalent to the blueprint ones and not weaker; the Lean
names are the blueprint's, so the `\lean{…}` links stay valid. -/

/-! ### The three pullbacks and the count: the informal statements

The following geometric estimates describe the downstairs-selection route.

**The rescaling pulls the image direction back to the inner direction**.

Write `m = T.center`, `f = T.direction`, `â = Ψ(T.x)`, `b̂ = Ψ(T.y)` and
`f̂ = (b̂ - â)/‖b̂ - â‖` for the unit direction of the image core.  The displacement `α • f̂`
*along the image core* pulls back to a displacement `α' • f` along the inner core — with no
transverse error at all — and `|α'| ≤ 4 R |α|`.

Stated forwards (see the section docstring): the assertion is that `α • f̂` is *hit* by such a
displacement, `Ψ(m + α' f) = Ψ m + α f̂`, which for the injective `Ψ` is the blueprint's
`Ψ⁻¹(m̂ + α f̂) = m + α' f`.  The scalar `α • ‖b̂ - â‖⁻¹` is folded into one coefficient of
`b̂ - â`, so that the unit vector `f̂` need not be named.

The linear part of `Ψ` is `(4 R)⁻¹ A` with `A` the linear part of `Φ_{T₀}`, so
`b̂ - â = (4 R)⁻¹ A f` and `α' = 4 R α / ‖A f‖`; the bound is `‖A f‖ ≥ ‖f‖ = 1`, which is
`Tube.dist_le_dist_normalization` and is where `0 < θ ≤ 1` is spent.

**Pulling a transverse displacement back through the rescaling**.

Suppose the inner direction `f = T.direction` is nearly parallel to the ambient axis
`e = T₀.direction`, `‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ e‖ ≤ κ θ`, and let `v` be a displacement of norm at most `s`
upstairs.  Its pullback `u` — the vector with `Ψ(z + u) = Ψ z + v`, which does not depend on
`z` — splits along and across `f` as

```
|⟪f, u⟫| ≤ 4 R (1 + θ) s,        ‖u - ⟪f, u⟫ f‖ ≤ 4 R (κ + 1) θ s.
```

The gain is the second bound: *perpendicularly to the inner direction* the pullback is smaller
by a factor `θ` than along it, which is what turns a `σ`-thickness upstairs into a
`τ`-thickness downstairs.  The parallel component is written `|⟪f, u⟫|` rather than
`‖⟪f, u⟫ • f‖`; the two agree because `‖f‖ = 1` (`Tube.norm_direction`).

The linear part of `Ψ⁻¹` is `4 R A⁻¹`, which is multiplication by `4 R` on `ℝ ∙ e` and by
`4 R θ` on `e^⊥`, so `u = 4 R (v^∥ + θ v^⊥)`; the transverse bound then uses
`‖e - ⟪f, e⟫ f‖ = ‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ e‖`, both sides being `sin ∠(e, f)`.  No upper bound on `θ` is
needed, only `0 < θ`, which is what makes `Ψ` invertible.

**Pulling a dilate of the outer tube back into a dilate of the inner tube**.

In the rescaling situation, with the inner direction nearly parallel to the ambient axis
(`‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ e‖ ≤ κ θ`) and `V = ext_σ[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` the outer tube of the image core,
every point whose image lies in the dilate `c · V` lies in the dilate
`(4 (κ + 2) R c) · T` downstairs.

This is the step that makes a *downstairs* selection possible: a failure of essential
distinctness upstairs is turned by `Kakeya.Tube.tubeOverlapCoreClose` into a containment in
`C_n · V`, and this lemma turns that into a containment in a bounded dilate of the original
`τ`-tube, where `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate` counts.

The two values used are `κ = 2`, which is `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset` for
`T ⊆ T₀`, and `κ = 4`, which is `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset_dilate` at `c = 2` for
`T ⊆ 2 · T₀`.

Assembly, from the two pullbacks above: `Kakeya.Tube.dilate_carrier_eq_cthickening` together
with `Tube.center_centredExtension` and `Tube.direction_centredExtension` writes a point of
`c · V` as `Ψ(T.center) + t • f̂ + v` with `|t| ≤ c / 2` and `‖v‖ ≤ c σ`; pulling back with
`Tube.rescale_symm_apply_add_smul` and `Tube.norm_rescale_symm_vector_le` at `s = c σ` puts
the point within `4 R (κ + 1) c τ` of the segment of length `8 R c` centred at `T.center`
along `f`, using `θ ≤ 1` and `σ ≤ 1/4` along `f` and `σ ≤ τ / θ` across it — both of which are
fields of `Tube.IsRescalingSituation`. -/

/-- **The constant `C_{lem:essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate}(n, c)`** of
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate`.

It is defined in Lean as the sum `essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.thinC n c +
essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.fatC n c` of the thin- and fat-regime summands:

```
C(n, c) = K_thin(n) c ^ (2n) + K_fat(n) c ^ (4n),
K_thin(n) = 24 ω_{n-1}² C_{lem:separatedSetCardBound}(2n-1) (32 n) ^ (2n-1),
K_fat(n)  = 6 ^ (2n) C_{lem:essDistinctTubeCount}(n).
```

The two summands are the two summands of `Tube.comparableReplacement.Kstar` — the thin and fat
regimes of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate` — each carrying its own power of the *free*
dilation ratio `c` in place of the fixed ratio `C_n` of that lemma.  As there,
`ω_d = 2 ^ d * Metric.coveringNumber_mul_pow_le_volume_cthickening.C d` and the packing
constant `C_{lem:separatedSetCardBound}(d) = 2 ^ d / ω_d` is the inverse of that abbreviation.
The constant is nondecreasing in `c` and depends only on `n` and `c`: not on the scale, not on
the tube and not on the family.

**The value is verified**: `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate` proves the bound with exactly
this constant.  The fat summand is the computation of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInFatDilate` with
`C_n` replaced by `c` and `C = 1`; the thin summand is what the parameter-space packing route
of `Tube.essDistinctTubesInThinDilate` produces under the same substitution, carried out here
as a reproof rather than a citation (`Tube.freeParameterMap` and the free-ratio lemmas
around it).  It is written down rather than left existential so that the numerical obligation
of `Kakeya.ml1Boot.exists_fineNormalization` can be checked at all.

The ratio is a real number, as `Kakeya.Tube.dilate` takes a real ratio, and is truncated by
`Real.toNNReal`; the intended range is `1 ≤ c`, where the truncation is inert. -/

/-- Free-ratio form of `Tube.parameterMap_mem_parameterRegion`: the free parameters of a
`δ`-tube inside `c · T` lie in the box of half-sides `(12 c² δ, c δ, c δ)`.

These are the half-sides `Tube.parameterRegion` collapses to at `C = 1`, ratio `c` and
`ρ = σ = δ`, so no free-ratio `parameterRegion` definition is needed: the box is written out.
The axial half-side is the product of the rescaling factor `(1/(4n)) δ / κ = 8 c δ` with the
axial bound `c/2 + c δ ≤ 3c/2` of `Tube.parameters_mem_of_subset_dilate_free`. -/

/-- **Counting essentially distinct tubes in a dilate of a tube of the same scale**.

A family of pairwise essentially distinct `δ`-tubes all contained in the dilate `c · T` of a
single `δ`-tube `T` has at most `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C n c` members.  Both scales
are `δ` here — hence *self* dilate — where `Tube.essDistinctTubesInDilate` has the two scales
`ρ` and `C⁻¹ ρ`; and the ratio `c` is free, where that lemma has the fixed ratio
`C_n = Kakeya.Tube.tubeOverlapCoreClose.C n`.  The free ratio is what the route needs, because
`Tube.preimage_rescale_dilate_subset_dilate` produces the ratio `4 (κ + 2) R C_n`.

The proof splits at `δ = 1/(4c)`, as in blueprint `note:essDistinctTubesInDilateRegimes`, and
the two regimes contribute the two summands of
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C`.  The fat regime `δ > 1/(4c)` is four lines:
`Kakeya.Tube.dilate_carrier_eq_cthickening` puts `c · T` inside `B̄(T.center, 3c/2)`, and
`Tube.card_le_of_EssDistinct` at radius `3c/2` counts there with `r / δ < 6 c²`, giving
`K_fat(n) c ^ (4n)`.  The thin regime `δ ≤ 1/(4c)` is the parameter-space packing count of
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInThinDilate`, which is stated *and* argued at the ratio `C_n`
throughout, so running it at a free ratio is a reproof rather than a citation. -/

/-! ### The three pullbacks, in Lean

The three statements of the rescaling and selection argument announced above are
supplied here, in the *forward* form explained in the section docstring. Only the metric layer of
`Tube.rescaleMap` is needed
for the first two, and they are stated at a general base point `z` rather than at the centre
`T.center` of the blueprint, which costs nothing and saves the consumer a rewriting step. -/

/-- **The rescaling pulls the image direction back to the inner direction**, stated forwards.

Write `Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R`, `f = T.direction`, `â = Ψ(T.x)`, `b̂ = Ψ(T.y)` and
`f̂ = (b̂ - â)/‖b̂ - â‖` for the unit direction of the image core.  Every displacement
`α • f̂` *along the image core* is hit by a displacement `α' • f` along the inner core — with
no transverse error at all — and `|α'| ≤ 4 R |α|`.

This is the blueprint's `Ψ⁻¹(m̂ + α f̂) = m + α' f` read forwards for the injective `Ψ`; the
scalar `α ‖b̂ - â‖⁻¹` is folded into one coefficient of `b̂ - â`, so the unit vector `f̂` is
not named.  The base point is a general `z`, the blueprint reading it at `z = T.center`.

The linear part of `Ψ` is `(4 R)⁻¹ A` with `A = Tube.normalizationLinear T₀`, so
`b̂ - â = (4 R)⁻¹ • A f` and `α' = 4 R α / ‖A f‖`; the bound is `‖A f‖ ≥ ‖f‖ = 1`, which is
`Tube.dist_le_dist_normalization` and is where `0 < θ ≤ 1` is spent. -/

/-- **Pulling a transverse displacement back through the rescaling**, stated forwards.

Write `Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R`, `e = T₀.direction` and `f = T.direction`, and suppose the
inner direction is nearly parallel to the ambient axis, `‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ • e‖ ≤ κ θ`.  Let `u` be
the pullback of a displacement `v` of norm at most `s`, that is `Ψ(z + u) = Ψ z + v` (a
condition that does not depend on `z`, `Ψ` being affine).  Then

```
|⟪f, u⟫| ≤ 4 R (1 + θ) s,        ‖u - ⟪f, u⟫ • f‖ ≤ 4 R (κ + 1) θ s.
```

The gain is the second bound: *perpendicularly to the inner direction* the pullback is smaller
by a factor `θ` than along it, which is what turns a `σ`-thickness upstairs into a
`τ`-thickness downstairs.

The linear part of `Ψ⁻¹` is `4 R A⁻¹` with `A = Tube.normalizationLinear T₀`, which is
multiplication by `4 R` on `ℝ ∙ e` and by `4 R θ` on `e^⊥`, so `u = 4 R (v^∥ + θ v^⊥)`; the
transverse bound then uses `‖e - ⟪f, e⟫ • f‖ = ‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ • e‖`, both sides being
`sin ∠(e, f)` by `InnerProductGeometry.norm_sub_inner_smul_eq_sin_angle` and
`InnerProductGeometry.angle_comm`.

`0 < θ` is what makes `Ψ` invertible; `θ ≤ 1` enters only through the coefficient `1 - θ` of
the parallel part of `A⁻¹`, and holds throughout, `θ` being a tube scale.  The blueprint
records no upper bound on `θ`, but at `θ > 2` the parallel bound as stated is false, the
coefficient being `|1 - θ| = θ - 1` there. -/

/-- **From a cardinality bound to a refinement, at a free constant**.

This is `Tube.isCRefinement_of_card_le` with the selection constant
`C_{lem:comparableBodiesToTubes}(n, C)` replaced by a variable `C₁ ≥ 1`.  The generalization is
a restatement and not an argument: the only use that proof makes of the fixed value is to know
it is nonzero.  It is needed because the affine selection route of
`Tube.exists_comparableReplacement_affine` produces the cardinality bound at the constant
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C n (4 (κ + 2) R C_n)` instead, and the existing statement
cannot be cited at that value.

The unused hypotheses of `Tube.isCRefinement_of_card_le` — `Nontrivial E`, `0 < ρ`,
`s.Nonempty` and `s'.Nonempty` — are dropped here. -/

/-- **Pulling a dilate of the outer tube back into a dilate of the inner tube**, stated forwards as
a preimage.

In the rescaling situation, with the inner direction nearly parallel to the ambient axis
(`‖f - ⟪e, f⟫ • e‖ ≤ κ θ`) and `V = ext_σ[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` the outer tube of the image core,
every point whose image under `Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R` lies in the dilate `c · V` lies in the
dilate `(4 (κ + 2) R c) · T` downstairs.

This is the step that makes a *downstairs* selection possible: a failure of essential
distinctness upstairs is turned by `Kakeya.Tube.tubeOverlapCoreClose` into a containment in
`C_n · V`, and this lemma turns that into a containment in a bounded dilate of the original
`τ`-tube, where `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate` counts.  The two values used downstream
are `κ = 2`, which is `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset` for `T ⊆ T₀`, and `κ = 4`, which
is `Tube.perp_norm_core_sub_le_of_subset_dilate` at `c = 2` for `T ⊆ 2 · T₀`.

The hypothesis `hxy` is not a restriction: `Ψ` is injective for `0 < θ` and `R ≠ 0`, and
`T.x ≠ T.y` because `dist T.x T.y = 1` (`Tube.dist_eq_one`).  It is taken as a hypothesis
rather than derived so that the outer tube `Tube.centredExtension σ hxy` can be named in the
statement.

Assembly, from the two pullbacks above: `Kakeya.Tube.dilate_carrier_eq_cthickening` together
with `Tube.center_centredExtension` and `Tube.direction_centredExtension` writes a point of
`c · V` as `Ψ(T.center) + t • f̂ + v` with `|t| ≤ c / 2` and `‖v‖ ≤ c σ`; pulling back with
`Tube.rescale_symm_apply_add_smul` and `Tube.norm_rescale_symm_vector_le` at `s = c σ` puts the
point within `4 R (κ + 1) c τ` of the segment of length `8 R c` centred at `T.center` along
`f`, using `θ ≤ 1` and `σ ≤ 1/4` along `f` and `σ ≤ τ / θ` across it — both of which are
fields of `Tube.IsRescalingSituation`. -/

/-! ### The affine replacement package

The two declarations below are the affine substitutes for `Tube.card_le_mul_card_of_dilateCover`
and `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement` on the fine-normalization route.  The hypothesis that
changes is the inner one: the inner honest `C⁻¹ ρ`-tubes `U_i ⊆ W_i` of the non-affine lemmas
— which that route *cannot* supply, the homothety of `Tube.rescaleMap` having shortened the
image core below unit length — give way to the hypothesis that the `W_i` are the images under
one invertible affine map `Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R` of honest, pairwise essentially distinct
`τ`-tubes lying nearly parallel to the ambient axis.  The selection is then made *downstairs*,
through `Tube.preimage_rescale_dilate_subset_dilate` and `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate`,
and the constant changes accordingly.

Everything else is unchanged: the multiplicity, fullness and Frostman items are proved from the
one-sided data alone and are literally `Tube.comparableTransport_oneSided`. -/

/-- **The fibre bound for a selection made downstairs**.

The affine analogue of `Tube.card_le_mul_card_of_dilateCover`.  The fibres
`A_i = {j ∈ s | 𝕋 j ⊆ c' · 𝕋 i}`, `i ∈ s'`, with `c' = 4 (κ + 2) R C_n`, cover `s`: a
`j ∈ s` has some `i ∈ s'` with `V_j ⊆ C_n · V_i`, and then
`Ψ(𝕋 j) ⊆ V_j ⊆ C_n · V_i`, so `Tube.preimage_rescale_dilate_subset_dilate` at `c = C_n`
puts `𝕋 j` inside `c' · 𝕋 i`.  Each fibre has at most
`Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C n c'` elements, the tubes `(𝕋 j)_{j ∈ A_i}` being
pairwise essentially distinct `τ`-tubes inside a dilate of the `τ`-tube `𝕋 i`; the cardinality
bound is then `Kakeya.card_le_card_cover_mul`.

The hypothesis `hxy` is not a restriction (see `Tube.preimage_rescale_dilate_subset_dilate`);
it is taken as a hypothesis so that the outer tubes `ext_σ[Ψ(𝕋 i).x, Ψ(𝕋 i).y]` can be named
in the statement. -/

/-- **Replacing affine images of tubes by honest tubes, selecting downstairs**.

This is `Tube.exists_comparableReplacement` with one hypothesis replaced by another: the inner
honest tubes `U_i ⊆ W_i` there — which cannot be supplied on the fine-normalization route —
give way to the hypothesis that the `W_i` sit inside the images under one invertible affine map
`Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R` of honest, pairwise essentially distinct `τ`-tubes `𝕋 i` lying
nearly parallel to the ambient axis, and that the outer `σ`-tubes are the centred extensions

Items (i)–(iii) are unchanged and are `Tube.comparableTransport_oneSided`, proved from the
one-sided data `W_i ⊆ V_i ⊆ K` and `|V_i| ≤ C |W_i|` alone.  The change is confined to items
(iv)–(v), which now go through `Tube.card_le_mul_card_of_dilateCover_affine`, and to the
selection constant, which is `Tube.essDistinctTubesInSelfDilate.C n (4 (κ + 2) R C_n)` rather
than `Tube.comparableReplacement.C n C`; the refinement clause is therefore cited at the free
constant, as `Tube.isCRefinement_of_card_le_free`. -/

/-! ### Step 2 of the fine normalization: the outer tube of a rescaled tube

The four auxiliary declarations below are the metric and measure layer of `Tube.rescaleMap`
that blueprint `lem:coreOuterTube` and `lem:rescaleImageVolumeRatio` need, followed by those
two lemmas themselves.  `Ψ = Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R` is the normalization `Φ_{T₀}` followed by
the homothety `z ↦ (z - T₀.x) / (4 R)`; being an affine equivalence with constant Jacobian it
divides every distance by `4 R` and every volume by `(4 R) ^ n`, on top of the factor
`θ ^ -(n-1)` of `Tube.volume_image_normalization`. -/

/-- **`Ψ` is an affine equivalence.**  For `0 < θ` and `0 < R` the map `Tube.rescaleMap T₀ R`
is the underlying affine map of an affine equivalence of `E`: it is `Tube.normalizationEquiv`
followed by a translation and a nonzero homothety.  Stated existentially, exactly as the
corresponding step inside `ShadedTube.normalizeInto_transport`, so that the transport lemmas
of `Kakeya/AffineMap.lean` — which take an `E ≃ᵃ[ℝ] E` — apply to `Ψ`. -/

```
|V| ≤ (C_{Tube.volume_le}(n) / c_{Tube.le_volume}(n)) * (4 R) ^ n * |W|.

Upper bound: `V` is a `σ`-tube with `σ ≤ 1`, so `Tube.volume_le` gives
`|V| ≤ C_{volume_le}(n) σ ^ (n-1)`.  Lower bound: `Tube.volume_image_rescaleMap` and

`V = ext_σ[Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)]` of the image core satisfies

*Thickness*: `IsNormalizationDistortion.image_subset_cthickening` and
`Tube.rescaleMap_image_subset_cthickening` put `W` in the closed `(C_N ρ / (4 R))`-

`hρσ`; `Tube.cthickening_subset_centredExtension` then gives `W ⊆ V`, its hypothesis
`dist (Ψ T.x) (Ψ T.y) ≤ 1` coming from `IsNormalizationDistortion.dist_le_C`.
*Position*: `hball` puts `Ψ(T.x), Ψ(T.y)` in `B̄(0, 1/4)`, and `σ ≤ 1/4` then gives
