# Equal-radius tube rigidity

For two `δ`-tubes of the same radius (unit core length), `A.carrier ⊆ B.carrier` forces
`A.carrier = B.carrier`. The `δ`-thickening on both sides cancels (a separation/support-function
argument), reducing to nested equal-length core segments, which must coincide.

Used to bound the leaf-scale (`ρ = δ`) bounded-overlap count by `≤ 1` without essential
distinctness: any two leaf tubes comparable (via a shared `δ`-tube) with a fixed `V` have
`carrier = V.carrier`, so distinct-carrier leaf tubes give at most one such comparable tube.
