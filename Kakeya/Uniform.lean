  # Uniform tube properties

  Telescoping volume estimates and density bounds that rely on uniform-tube
  hypotheses at each scale, formulated via `Tube.IsUniformAtScale`.
  Split out of `Kakeya/Sticky.lean` to collect uniform-tube material in one
  place.

  The file collects `Tube.IsUniformAtScale` and its supporting `Tube`-level
  uniformity results. Uniformity of a
  shaded family (GWZ Definition 2.2) is
  `ShadedTube.ShadedUniformTubeSet` in
  `Kakeya/ShadedUniform.lean`, together with the shade-fibre pigeonholing it is
  built on.

## Uniform sets of tubes, read as a multiscale hierarchy

This section is the replacement for `Tube.IsUniform`.

### Why the per-scale reading is not enough

`Tube.IsUniform s T scales C` is `∀ ρ ∈ scales, Nonempty (Tube.IsUniformAtScale s T ρ C)`: it
records GWZ Definition 2.1(i)–(iii) independently at each scale and therefore relates the parent
families at different scales in *no way at all*.  The node of `𝕋_{ρ_k}` containing a given leaf need
not sit inside the node of `𝕋_{ρ_{k-1}}` containing it.

That is not the object the multiscale argument uses.  Wang–Zahl need `𝕋_{ρ_j}` to cover
`𝕋_{ρ_{j+1}}`, not merely to cover `𝕋`, and they say so explicitly: see
Wang-Zahl, where the covers obtained scale by scale are *repaired*
into a nested family at the cost of dilating each parent by `2ρ_{j+1}` — and where it is recorded
that after the repair the parents need no longer be essentially distinct nor form a partitioning
cover.  The blueprint's `def:indexedTubeHierarchy` is the nested object.

`UniformTubeSet` is that object: the hierarchy `cover`, together with Definition 2.1(ii)–(iii) read
directly on the *classes* of that hierarchy.  Nothing bundles a per-scale `Tube.IsUniformAtScale`,
because the containment reading of Definition 2.1(iii) cannot supply the lower bound on a class:
a node may contain members of other classes.

/-! ### Classes of a cover -/

/-- The class `u⟨P⟩` of a node `P` in an index set `u` carrying an assignment: the members of `u`
assigned to `P`.  Since the assignment is a *function*, the classes partition `u` — this is what
makes GWZ Definition 2.1's cover a *partitioning* cover, and it is what the nestedness condition
below is stated against. -/

/-! ### The nested system of covers -/

/-- **A nested system of covers along the grid**.

At each grid index `k ≤ N` the members of `t` are *assigned* to nodes, each node is a tube of the
exact grid radius `ρ_k`, and the classes refine as the scale gets finer: if two members share a node
at index `k+1` they share one at index `k`.  That last clause is the content Wang–Zahl have to
repair by hand (Wang-Zahl) and is exactly what a per-scale uniformity predicate
cannot supply. -/

  /-- …and so do the nodes themselves: a member's node at index `k+1` lies inside its node at index
  `k`.  The tower builder supplies this alongside the index-level clause at no extra cost, and it is
  what makes `Tube.UniformTubeSet.nodesUnder` the faithful `𝕋_b[T_a]`, with no inflation of

/-- **GWZ Definition 2.1, read as a multiscale hierarchy.**  `cover` is the nested system of covers,
carrying Definition 2.1(i); the remaining fields are Definition 2.1(ii) (bounded overlap) and (iii)

admits no uniform structure at all.  A single constant `C` governs both. -/

  which is the containment (i) asks for, and more, since the assignment is a function and the

development comes from a tight grid net, so the condition costs nothing to supply and is preserved
by restriction.  Node distinctness is not repeated here — it is the `tube_injOn` field. -/

### Why the class reading, and not the containment reading

The class bracket implies the containment bracket `{i ∈ s | T i ≤ tube k j}` of the per-scale
reading, with `C ^ 2` in place of `C`, but not conversely.  Upwards is immediate, since
`le_tube_assign` puts each class inside its own node.  Downwards: if `T i` lies in the node `j`,
then the node `j' = assign k i` that `i` is actually assigned to shares the member `i` with
`tube k j`, so `j'` is one of the at most `C` nodes that Definition 2.1(ii) permits to meet
`tube k j` through `s`; summing the class bound over those `C` nodes bounds the contained set by
`C ^ 2 * branchingN k`.  The lower direction needs nothing, the class being a subset of the
contained set.

This is why the class reading is the one stored: it is strictly stronger, it is WZ's
partitioning-cover reading, and the containment reading is recoverable from it whenever some
consumer of the old per-scale API wants it.

### The nodes of one level inside a node of a coarser one
-/

/-- The nodes at grid index `b` lying inside a prescribed container `K`.

The container is an arbitrary convex body rather than a node, because the two consumers need
different ones.  Alternative (ii)-2 of Lemma 7.7(A) uses the node itself, for which
`UniformTubeSet.nodesUnder` below is the specialization.  Alternative (ii)-3 is a *lower* bound and
needs the container inflated: it is deduced from a leaf-anchored bound whose anchor
`T_{i_0}^{(2\rho)}` is twice as thick as the node, so the nodes of the members it counts are only
guaranteed to lie in a bounded dilate of the node, and inflating an anchor is exactly what a lower
bound cannot absorb after the fact. -/

/-- WZ's `𝕋_b[T_a]`: the nodes at grid index `b` lying inside the node `j` at the coarser index `a`
(Wang-Zahl, read on the cover rather than on `𝕋`).

Containment is literal, with no inflation of the container.  That is available because
`GridCoverSystem.tube_nested` carries the nesting of the nodes themselves; it is precisely the
clause Wang–Zahl have to restore by hand at the cost of a `2ρ` dilation. -/

/-- **The nodes meeting a tube through `s`**.

For a grid index `k` and a `ρ_k`-tube `V`, the set of nodes at index `k` that *meet `V` through
`s`*: those sharing a member of the family with `V`, that is, those `j` for which some `i ∈ s`
has `T i ⊆ tube k j` and `T i ⊆ V`.

This is a name for the object `Tube.UniformTubeSet.boundedOverlap` already quantifies
over — the same `Finset.filter` — so that the field is literally a bound on its cardinality
(`Tube.UniformTubeSet.card_meetingNodes_le`).

The relativization by `s` is essential and not a convenience: bare intersection with `V` is not
a bounded condition, a fixed `ρ_k`-tube being met, as a set, by `ρ_k`-tubes of every direction. -/

/-- **Definition 2.1(ii) for a family that is not a hierarchy**.

A family `𝕍_ρ = (Vρ k)_{k ∈ t}` of `ρ`-tubes has *overlap bounded by `Co` through
`𝕍 = (V i)_{i ∈ s}`* when, for every `ρ`-tube `W`, at most `Co` members of `𝕍_ρ` *meet `W`
through `𝕍`* — share a member of `𝕍` with it.

This is `Tube.UniformTubeSet.boundedOverlap` transcribed off the nodes of a hierarchy
word for word: taking `t` to be a node index set, `Vρ` the node tubes at that grid index and `V`
the leaves recovers the field exactly, which is what
`Kakeya.ml1Boot.hasBoundedOverlap_nodes` records. It lives here rather than downstream because
it is the same condition as the field, and because both a free family and a hierarchy's nodes
have to be able to supply it.

The relativization by `𝕍` is what makes the condition satisfiable at all: bare intersection with
`W` is not a bounded condition, a fixed `ρ`-tube being met, as a set, by `ρ`-tubes of every
direction.

It is the achievable `∼1`-multiplicity content of Definition 2.1(ii), and it is what the nodes
of a hierarchy carry *instead of* pairwise essential distinctness, which they cannot satisfy
while preserving cardinality. -/

/-- **The faithful form: GWZ Definition 2.1 at its own grid length.**  The same conclusion as
`exists_uniformTubeSet_subfamily`, instantiated at the `δ`-dependent `N = ⌈log log 1/δ⌉` of GWZ
Definition 2.1 and with the loss absorbed into a prescribed `δ^{-α}`.  Two things are paid for: a
cardinality bound `#s ≤ δ^{-K₀}`, which turns the polylogarithm in `#s` into one in `1/δ`, and a
threshold `δ₀(α, K₀, n)` for the absorption, which also secures the side conditions at this `N`. -/
