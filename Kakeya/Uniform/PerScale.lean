# The per-scale reading of GWZ Definitions 2.1 and 2.2

Additional estimates, which states parts of Section 6
against the per-scale reading of uniformity rather than against the multiscale hierarchy
`Tube.UniformTubeSet` used in `Kakeya/Uniform.lean` and `Kakeya/ShadedUniform.lean`.

Only the two *definitions* are stated.

Consequently `Kakeya.ShadedTube.IsUniform` has, in this development, no producer: every statement
below that quotes it quotes it as a *hypothesis*.
